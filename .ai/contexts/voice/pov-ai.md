## Summary

Our contrarian, expert beliefs about AI's role in presentations. These inform how we talk about AI in content, marketing, and product positioning. Consistent with our core philosophy: structure and thinking matter more than tools.

## Core Position: AI Amplifies Methodology, Doesn't Replace It

### "AI doesn't fix bad thinking — it scales it"
> If you can't structure an argument yourself, AI will produce a beautifully formatted mess. Fast garbage is still garbage.

**Contrast:** The "just give me AI" crowd thinks the tool does the thinking. It doesn't.

**Hook angles:**
- "The AI presentation tool that doesn't replace your brain"
- "Why AI-generated decks are failing in boardrooms"
- "ChatGPT can write your slides. Your CFO still won't buy it."

---

### "The best AI presentations start with human thinking"
> AI is incredible at execution — generating slides, formatting data, designing layouts. But the strategic decisions — what's the argument? what's the evidence? what does the audience care about? — those are human jobs.

**Implication:** The professionals who will win are the ones who combine strong presentation methodology with AI speed.

---

### "AI makes good presenters great. It makes bad presenters faster."
> If you understand structure, MECE, and evidence-based persuasion, AI becomes a force multiplier. If you don't, it just helps you produce mediocre decks more quickly.

**Hook angles:**
- "AI isn't your presentation coach. It's your presentation accelerator."
- "The presentation skill AI can't replace (and the ones it can)"

---

## AI & The SlideHeroes Methodology

### "Structure is the one thing AI can't reliably do (yet)"
> AI can generate bullet points, find data, create charts, and design beautiful layouts. But organizing a 40-page deck into a logically airtight argument? That still requires human judgment — knowing what to emphasize, what to cut, and what sequence makes the case.

**Why this matters for us:** This is exactly what DDM teaches. As AI handles more of the execution, the *strategic thinking* skills we teach become MORE valuable, not less.

---

### "AI is the junior analyst. You're the partner."
> Think of AI as a very fast, very capable junior hire. It can pull data, draft slides, format charts. But it needs direction. It needs someone who knows what a good deck looks like to say "this argument doesn't hold" or "this chart doesn't prove the headline."

**Hook angles:**
- "How to manage your AI the way McKinsey manages analysts"
- "AI is only as good as the brief you give it"

---

### "The AI presentation problem isn't generation — it's quality control"
> Anyone can generate 20 slides in 60 seconds. The problem is that 18 of them are mediocre. Without presentation methodology, you can't tell which 2 are good. You need a trained eye to review, refine, and rebuild.

---

## What We Think About AI Tools

### "Most AI presentation tools optimize for the wrong thing"
> They optimize for speed and visual polish. A 10-slide deck in 30 seconds! But speed was never the hard part. The hard part is making the argument land. Making the evidence compelling. Making the structure follow a logic the audience can follow.

**Contrast:** Canva, Beautiful.ai, Gamma, Tome — they make it fast. We make it good.

---

### "An AI that doesn't understand MECE is just a template engine"
> If the AI doesn't enforce structural discipline — mutual exclusivity, logical hierarchy, evidence-backed assertions — it's just filling in blanks. Pretty blanks, but blanks.

---

### "Templates with AI is not the same as methodology with AI"
> Lots of tools offer AI + templates. That's step one. Real value comes from AI that understands *why* McKinsey decks work — the principles behind the structure, not just the visual layout.

## Our AI Philosophy for Content

### When Writing About AI
1. **Be balanced, not hyperbolic** — AI is powerful AND has real limitations
2. **Always connect back to methodology** — AI is the tool, methodology is the skill
3. **Challenge "AI replaces everything" narratives** — They're wrong for high-stakes presentations
4. **Position SlideHeroes as the bridge** — We teach the thinking that makes AI useful

### When Comparing to AI Tools
- Don't trash competitors — acknowledge what they do well
- Differentiate on depth: tools focus on creation, we focus on *quality* of what's created
- Our unique angle: we bring consulting methodology + AI, not just AI

### The SlideHeroes AI Narrative
> "Other tools give you AI to make slides. We give you the methodology to make AI useful."

2. **Content marketing** — Contrarian AI takes generate high engagement
3. **Competitive positioning** — Methodology depth is our moat against tool-only competitors
