## Summary

Our contrarian, expert beliefs about presentations. Use these to generate hooks, challenge conventional wisdom, and maintain consistent positioning across content.

## Identity: What Business Presentations ARE

### "Business presentations are NOT speeches"
> 'Sit-down' McKinsey-style business presentations around a board table are fundamentally different from public speaking and require a completely different approach to communication.

**Contrast:** Most 'presentation tips' are actually speech tips — and they'll get you fired in a boardroom.

**Hook angles:**
- Challenge the TED-talk obsession ruining business communication
- "Why does your boss roll their eyes when you try to 'inspire' them?"

### "This is NOT a performance — it IS business"
> Your presentation to your board, boss, customer, or investor is not a TED Talk. It is not a speech. It is not public speaking.

**Contrast:** Stop worrying about your opening joke and start worrying about your structure.

## Structure: How to Organize Your Argument

### "Answer a question, don't present a topic"
> Rather than presenting about 'Customer Relationship Management Software', present an answer to the question 'Our CRM software is old, does it need to be replaced?'

**Example:**
- Topic: "2022 Marketing Plan"
- Question: "What is the best plan for accelerating growth?"
- The resulting presentations would be VERY different.

### "Structure is how you help your audience follow"
> When the audience cannot follow your logic, they become frustrated. They get pissed off. They stop paying attention. Structure is how you signpost where you are going.

**Implication:** Expect half your time to be spent working on structure.

### "Limit your lists to no more than 5 items"
> If you have more than 5 items, bucket these ideas into a new set of groupings, one level of abstraction higher. Apply MECE principles.

---

## Evidence: Demonstrate, Don't Assert

### "Demonstrate, don't simply assert"
> Your credibility skyrockets when you demonstrate the truth of your assertions through data, facts, or very compelling logic.

**Contrast:** The 'because I say so' argument is surprisingly common in presentations.

### "Footnotes provide credibility"
> When you cite numbers and statistics, say where you got the data. Not providing footnotes is, at best, lazy, and at worst, dishonest.

### "State your survey population (n)"
> With survey data, state the size of the survey population. The bigger the n, the more confidence readers have. Easier to anticipate the question.

---

## Data Visualization

### "Don't use pie charts"
> Don't use pie charts, crazy animations, 3D, or random special effects. Just don't. Resist the temptation to sex things up.

### "Chart type must match the data relationship"
| Relationship | Chart |
|--------------|-------|
| Nominal comparison | Bar chart |
| Time series | Line chart |
| Ranking | Sorted bar chart |
| Part-to-whole | Stacked bar (not pie!) |
| Correlation | Scatter plot |

### "A cardinal sin: when you can't see the point in the data"
> It is a cardinal sin when you cannot actually see in the data the point being made in the headline. The chart must visually prove the headline's claim.

---

## Design

### "Design is important — it just isn't everything"
> Your objective is not to create a pretty deck. The objective is to communicate your point. Having said this, design matters. I can't take you seriously if you can't be bothered to make your deck look good.

### "Reserve each slide for a single primary idea"
> Write concise two-line headlines that make your main assertion. One slide, one idea.

### "Headlines should be assertions, not labels"
**Before:** "Q3 Revenue"
**After:** "Q3 Revenue exceeded forecast by 12%"

### "Create slides that are scannable"
> Employ the three-second rule — people should be able to 'get' the slide in 1, 2, 3 seconds.

---

## Audience

### "Identify the Power Behind The Throne"
> Who has power? Who makes decisions? Sometimes it's not clear who the real decision makers are. Once identified, determine how they like to consume information.

### "What Is In It For Them?"
> The most effective formula to ensuring your audience connects with your material is to give a presentation about something they care about.

---

## Delivery

### "If your meeting is important enough for a presentation, it's important enough for a GREAT one"
> If your meeting is important enough to prepare a presentation for, it is important enough to prepare a great presentation for. Put in the effort.

### "Have conviction in your material — or have someone else present"
> If you don't have conviction, work harder. Demonstrate passion. If you can't fake it, have someone else present.

### "End with clear next steps"
> The objective of your presentation should be for your audience to DO SOMETHING. Identify your desired next step early and design the presentation so it's the logical consequence.
