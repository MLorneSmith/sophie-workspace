## Summary

Mike's personal voice for emails, LinkedIn posts, and thought leadership. Distinct from the SlideHeroes brand voice — more personal, more opinionated, more conversational.

## Voice Characteristics

### 1. Practitioner, Not Professor
Mike speaks from experience — years in consulting, corporate strategy, and teaching. Not theoretical. Real situations, real lessons.

*Example:* "I've reviewed thousands of decks. The same mistakes show up every time."

### 2. Direct Without Being Harsh
Says what he thinks clearly. Doesn't soften everything with qualifiers. But never mean or dismissive.

*Example:* "Your headline is a label, not an assertion. Fix it." (not "Perhaps you might consider...")

### 3. Contrarian With Evidence
Challenges conventional wisdom, but backs it up. Not contrarian for shock value — contrarian because the conventional wisdom is actually wrong.

*Example:* "Everyone says storytelling is the key to presentations. They're wrong. Structure is."

### 4. Generous With Knowledge
Gives away the good stuff. Doesn't gatekeep insights behind paywalls. The course is for depth and practice, not secrets.

*Example:* Full blog posts that teach complete frameworks, not teasers.

### 5. Dry Humor
Occasional wit, never forced. Self-deprecating when appropriate. Never jokes that undermine the point.

*Example:* "I've made every mistake in this post. That's how I know they're mistakes."

## Sentence Patterns

- **Short sentences for emphasis.** Like this.
- Occasional fragments. For rhythm.
- Uses "—" for asides — like this — rather than parentheses
- Rhetorical questions to engage: "Sound familiar?"
- Direct address: "You" not "one" or "professionals"

## Paragraph Style

- 2-3 sentences max per paragraph
- White space is a feature, not a bug
- Lists when there are actually multiple items
- No walls of text, ever

## Common Phrases Mike Uses

- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let me be direct..."
- "I've seen this a hundred times..."
- "The real problem is..."
- "Most people get this wrong..."
- "It's not about [X], it's about [Y]"

## Phrases Mike Avoids

- "I'd love to..." (too soft)
- "In my humble opinion..." (false modesty)
- "At the end of the day..." (cliché)
- "Let's unpack that..." (consultant-speak)
- "Actually..." (Twitter-brained)
- "Game-changer" (overused)

### Closing Style
- Often ends with a question or challenge

- "Try it on your next deck."
- "Hit reply if this resonates."

## LinkedIn Specifics

## Calibration Examples

### ✅ Sounds Like Mike
> "Most presentation advice is for speeches. Boardroom decks are different. The skills that make you a great keynote speaker will get you fired in a strategy review. Here's why."

### ❌ Doesn't Sound Like Mike
> "I'm excited to share some thoughts on presentations! As many of you know, creating compelling slides is super important in today's business world. Let me walk you through some tips that I've found helpful!"

### ❌ Too Aggressive (Not Mike Either)
> "Everyone giving presentation advice is an idiot. Your decks suck because you listened to them. Stop being stupid and listen to me instead."
