## Summary

Expert but approachable, contrarian but helpful, rigorous but not academic. We're the experienced colleague who's done this a thousand times and wants to save you from the mistakes everyone makes.

## Voice Attributes

### 1. Contrarian
**Challenge bad advice that's everywhere.**

We're not afraid to say "most presentation tips are wrong." We push back against TED-talk worship, pie chart defenders, and anyone who thinks "good design" means more animations.

*Example:* "Most presentation advice will get you fired in a boardroom."

### 2. Expert
**We know what we're talking about.**

No hedging, no "it depends on your situation." We've seen enough presentations to know what works. We speak with authority because we've earned it.

*Example:* "Headlines should be assertions, not labels. Period."

### 3. Generous
**Give away valuable insights freely.**

Our best content is free. We don't gatekeep the methodology. The course is for people who want structure, practice, and depth — not secrets.

*Example:* Entire blog posts that teach complete frameworks, not teasers.

### 4. Direct
**No corporate fluff.**

Short sentences. Clear points. If something's wrong, we say it's wrong. We respect readers' time.

*Example:* "Don't use pie charts. Just don't."

### 5. Practical
**Always actionable.**

Every piece of content should leave the reader able to *do something* differently. Theory serves practice, never the reverse.

*Example:* Not "structure is important" but "limit lists to 5 items — here's why and how."

## Tone Variations by Context

| Context | Tone Adjustment |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Email to subscribers** | Warmer, more personal, first-person |
| **Blog post** | Educational, thorough, more examples |
| **Outbound cold email** | Shorter, more direct, clear value prop |
| **LinkedIn post** | Punchy, contrarian hooks, conversation-starting |
| **Course content** | Patient, encouraging, step-by-step |

## Language We Use

- "McKinsey-style" (not just "professional")
- "Sit-down presentations" (not "business presentations")
- "Demonstrate, don't assert"
- "Answer a question, don't present a topic"
- "The boardroom" (not "your meeting")
- "Structure" before "design"
- "Evidence" (not just "data")

## Language We Avoid

| Avoid | Instead |
|-------|---------|
| "Presentation tips" | "Presentation methodology" |
| "Public speaking" | "Business communication" |
| "Inspire your audience" | "Convince your audience" |
| "Make it pop" | "Make it clear" |
| "Storytelling" (overused) | "Narrative structure" |
| "Hacks" or "tricks" | "Techniques" or "approaches" |
| "Game-changer" | (just explain the benefit) |
| "Actually..." | (too Twitter-brained) |

## Grammar & Style

- **Active voice** preferred
- **Second person** ("you") in emails and blogs
- **Short paragraphs** — 2-3 sentences max
- **Oxford comma** — yes
- **Numbers** — spell out one through nine, numerals for 10+
- **Headlines** — sentence case, not Title Case

## Examples

### Good SlideHeroes Voice:
> "Your headline should clearly lay out the takeaway of your slide. Not 'Q3 Revenue.' Instead: 'Q3 Revenue exceeded forecast by 12%.' See the difference? One is a label. The other is an assertion. Labels are lazy. Assertions show you've done the thinking."

### Bad (Too Generic):
> "It's really important to have good headlines on your slides! A great headline can make all the difference in whether your audience pays attention. Try to make your headlines engaging and informative."

### Bad (Too Academic):
> "Research in cognitive psychology suggests that declarative headlines facilitate information processing by providing advance organizers that prime the audience's schema for the subsequent content."
