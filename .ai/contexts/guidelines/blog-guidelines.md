## Summary

Guidelines for creating SlideHeroes blog posts. Focused on SEO, readability, and establishing authority — while maintaining the SlideHeroes voice.

---

## Content Strategy

### Purpose of the Blog
1. **SEO:** Attract organic traffic for presentation-related searches
2. **Authority:** Establish SlideHeroes as the expert in business presentations
3. **Value:** Provide genuinely useful content (generous, not gated)
4. **Funnel:** Introduce readers to SlideHeroes methodology and courses

### Content Pillars
| Pillar | Topics |
|--------|--------|
| **Structure** | Organizing arguments, pyramid principle, MECE |
| **Data Visualization** | Charts, graphs, tables, evidence |
| **Design** | Slide layout, headlines, visual hierarchy |
| **Strategy** | Audience analysis, executive presentations, pitch decks |
| **Common Mistakes** | Teardowns, critiques, what not to do |

---

## Word Count

- **Target range:** 2000-3000 words
- **Hard minimum:** 2000 words — no exceptions
- **No fluff posts.** Every post should be a comprehensive, substantive piece. If a topic can't sustain 2000+ words of genuinely useful content, it's either the wrong topic or needs to be combined with another.

## SEO Requirements

### Keyword Strategy
- Primary keyword in title, H1, and first 100 words
- Secondary keywords in H2s
- Keyword density: 1-2% for primary keyword
- Natural usage — don't force keywords

### Technical SEO
- **Title tag:** Under 60 characters, keyword near front
- **Meta description:** 120-160 characters, include keyword, compelling
- **URL slug:** Short, includes primary keyword, hyphens not underscores
- **Internal links:** Minimum 2 links to other SlideHeroes content
- **External links:** At least 1 link to authoritative source

### Content Length
- **Minimum:** 1,000 words (for ranking)
- **Ideal:** 1,500-2,500 words (comprehensive coverage)
- **Maximum:** 3,500 words (before splitting into series)
