## Summary

Guidelines for SlideHeroes social media content, primarily LinkedIn. Focus on thought leadership, engagement, and driving awareness — not direct selling.

---

## Platform Focus

### Primary: LinkedIn
- Mike's personal profile (thought leadership)
- SlideHeroes company page (brand content)
- Where our audience lives and consumes professional content

### Secondary: Twitter/X
- Occasional cross-posting of key content
- Lower priority than LinkedIn

### Not Focus: Instagram, TikTok, Facebook
- Wrong audience demographics
- Don't invest time here

---

## LinkedIn Strategy

### Goals
1. **Awareness:** Get SlideHeroes in front of target audience
2. **Authority:** Establish Mike as the go-to expert on business presentations
3. **Engagement:** Build community, spark conversations
4. **Traffic:** Drive to blog, landing pages (secondary goal)

### Content Mix
| Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Contrarian takes | 2-3x/week | Engagement, authority |
| Practical tips | 1-2x/week | Value, shareability |
| Behind-the-scenes | 1x/week | Humanity, connection |
| Wins/milestones | As they happen | Social proof |
| Curated/comments | Ongoing | Community presence |

## Post Structure

### The Hook (First 2 Lines)
Critical — this is what shows before "see more"

**Hook Types:**
- **Contrarian:** "Most presentation advice is wrong."
- **Bold claim:** "I've reviewed 1,000+ decks. The same 3 mistakes show up every time."
- **Question:** "Why do execs tune out in the first 30 seconds?"
- **Story start:** "A client sent me their pitch deck last week..."
- **Pattern interrupt:** "Stop using pie charts. I don't care what your boss says."

### The Body
- One idea per post (not a blog post summary)
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- Lots of white space
- Use line breaks liberally
- Can use bullet points sparingly

### The Close
- Clear takeaway or question
- Engagement prompt ("Agree or disagree?")
- Don't always CTA to SlideHeroes — most posts should just give value

### Formatting
```
Hook line here.

Second line that builds on the hook.

Short paragraph with the main point.

• Optional bullet if listing
• Keep bullets short
• Max 3-5 items

Takeaway or question to end.
```

## Content Themes

### What to Post About

**Presentation Insights**
- Specific rules/tips (one per post)
- Common mistakes and how to fix them
- Before/after examples
- "I saw this in a deck recently..." stories

**Industry Commentary**
- New tools and what they get wrong/right
- AI and presentations (balanced take)
- What executives actually want

**Contrarian Takes**
- Challenge TED-talk worship
- Push back on design-first thinking
- Call out bad advice that's popular

**Personal/Founder Journey**
- Lessons from building SlideHeroes
- Behind-the-scenes of course creation
- Honest reflections (not humble-brags)

### What NOT to Post

- Self-congratulatory "I'm so grateful" posts
- Engagement bait without substance
- Political or divisive content
- Complaints or negativity
- Pure promotion every post

---

## Voice on Social

### Mike's LinkedIn Voice
- First person ("I")
- Direct, opinionated
- Conversational, not formal
- Okay to be bold/contrarian
- Self-deprecating humor occasionally

### Things Mike Would Say
- "Unpopular opinion: [contrarian take]"
- "I've made this mistake more times than I can count."
- "Here's what nobody tells you about..."
- "The best [presentation/deck/pitch] I ever saw..."

### Things Mike Wouldn't Say
- "I'm humbled to announce..."
- "Thrilled to share..."
- "Excited about my journey..."
- "Let's connect and grow together!"

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Responding to Comments
- Reply to thoughtful comments (don't ignore engagement)
- Ask follow-up questions
- Thank people who share insights
- Handle disagreement with curiosity, not defensiveness

### Proactive Engagement
- Comment on relevant posts from others
- Share others' good content (with commentary)
- Tag people when genuinely relevant (not for reach)
- Engage in relevant LinkedIn groups

### What Not to Do
- Generic comments ("Great post!")
- Comment just for algorithm
- Tag people for exposure without real relevance
- Argue with trolls

---

## Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Comments | Indicates resonance, sparks conversation |
| Shares | Content worth spreading |
| Profile views | Awareness building |
| Follower quality | Right audience, not vanity numbers |
| Link clicks | When we do promote, is it working? |

### Metrics That Don't Matter
- Total impressions (vanity)
- Likes alone (low signal)
- Follower count (quality > quantity)

---

## Posting Cadence

### Recommended
- **LinkedIn:** 3-5 posts/week from Mike
- **Company page:** 2-3 posts/week
- **Best times:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 12-1pm (target timezone)

### Rules
- Quality > quantity
- Don't post just to post
- Okay to skip days if nothing worth saying
- Batch-create when inspired, schedule out
