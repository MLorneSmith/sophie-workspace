## Summary

Guidelines for cold outreach emails to prospects. Different from marketing emails — shorter, more direct, higher personalization requirements, stricter deliverability rules.

## Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Relevance over volume** — One great personalized email beats 100 templates
2. **Start conversations, not sales pitches** — Goal is a reply, not a purchase
3. **Respect their time** — Under 100 words is ideal
4. **Earn the right to their attention** — Show you've done homework
5. **Be human** — No one wants to reply to a robot

## Email Structure

### Subject Line (Critical)
- **Length:** Under 40 characters
- **Style:** Lowercase, conversational, specific
- **Goal:** Get opened, not summarize content

**Examples:**
- ✅ "quick question about [company]'s pitch decks"
- ✅ "saw your post on consulting deliverables"
- ✅ "[mutual connection] suggested I reach out"
- ❌ "Improve Your Presentation Skills Today!"
- ❌ "SlideHeroes - Premium Presentation Training"

### Opening Line (First 10 words)
Must demonstrate relevance immediately. No "I hope this email finds you well."

**Personalization anchors:**
- Recent LinkedIn post or activity
- Company news or announcement
- Mutual connection
- Specific content they created
- Role change or promotion

### Body (40-80 words)
- **Problem acknowledgment:** Show you understand their world
- **Value hint:** What you can help with (not a feature list)
- **No hard sell:** You're starting a conversation

### CTA (One, specific)
- **Low commitment:** "Worth a quick chat?" not "Book a demo"
- **Binary:** Easy yes/no, not open-ended
- **Time-bound (optional):** "15 minutes this week?"

## Personalization Requirements

| Element | Requirement | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Company name | Required | Research |
| First name | Required | LinkedIn |
| Personalization hook | Required | Posts, content, news |
| Role-specific pain point | Required | Persona context |
| Mutual connection | If available | LinkedIn |

**Personalization Score Threshold:** ≥ 70%

### Personalization Hooks (Ranked)

1. **Specific reference to their content** — "Your post about [X] resonated..."
2. **Company-specific insight** — "Noticed [company] just launched [Y]..."
3. **Role-specific challenge** — "Most [role]s I talk to struggle with..."
4. **Mutual connection** — "[Name] suggested I reach out..."
5. **Industry trend** — "Given what's happening in [industry]..."

## Sequence Structure

### Typical 4-Email Sequence

| Email | Timing | Purpose | Tone |
|-------|--------|---------|------|
| 1 | Day 0 | Initial outreach | Curious, personalized |
| 2 | Day 3 | Follow-up with value | Helpful, add insight |
| 3 | Day 7 | Different angle | Reframe the problem |
| 4 | Day 14 | Breakup | Direct, respectful close |

### Breakup Email (Final)
Short, no pressure, leaves door open:
> "I'll assume the timing isn't right. If presentations ever become a priority, happy to chat. Good luck with [specific thing they're working on]."

## Deliverability Rules

### Spam Triggers (Avoid)
- ALL CAPS anywhere
- Multiple exclamation points!!!
- Spam words: "free," "guarantee," "act now," "limited time"
- Too many links (max 1-2)
- Large images or attachments
- Fake urgency

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Plain text or minimal HTML
- [ ] No tracking pixels in cold email (optional)
- [ ] Under 100 words ideal, 150 max
- [ ] Single CTA
- [ ] Proper unsubscribe (if required by volume)

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Subject line < 40 chars, lowercase
- [ ] Personalization hook in first 2 lines
- [ ] Body under 100 words
- [ ] Single, low-commitment CTA
- [ ] No spam trigger words
- [ ] Sounds human (read aloud test)
- [ ] Personalization score ≥ 70%

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| "I'd love to pick your brain" | Asks for something, gives nothing |
| Long paragraphs explaining your product | They won't read it |
| "We help companies like yours..." | Generic, template-obvious |
| Fake personalization | "I saw your company is in [industry]" |
| Multiple asks | Confusing, reduces response |
| "Circling back" | Annoying, no new value |
| "Did you get my last email?" | Guilt-trip, never works |

## Voice for Outbound

Outbound from SlideHeroes should sound like:
- A peer, not a salesperson
- Curious about their work
- Confident but not pushy
- Specific, not generic

**Test:** Would you reply to this if you received it?
