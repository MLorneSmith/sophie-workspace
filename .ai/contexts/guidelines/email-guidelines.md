## Summary

Guidelines for writing SlideHeroes marketing emails (newsletters, nurture sequences). Based on Andre Chaperon's methodology — relationship-first, value-forward, story-driven.

## Philosophy

### Andre Chaperon's Core Principles

1. **Build relationships through email** — Not just broadcasts, but conversations
2. **Lead with value, not pitch** — Give before you ask
3. **Stories beat arguments** — Narrative is more persuasive than logic alone
4. **Open loops create anticipation** — Make them want the next email
5. **Respect attention** — Every email should be worth their time

## Email Structure

### The Hook (First 2-3 lines)
The most important part. Gets them to keep reading.

**Hook Types:**
- **Contrarian:** Challenge conventional wisdom
- **Story:** Start in the middle of action
- **Question:** Provoke curiosity
- **Confession:** Admit a mistake or weakness
- **Observation:** Share something you noticed
- **Payoff promise:** Tell them what they'll get

**Hook Quality Threshold:** Score ≥ 40/50 (validated by hook scorer)

### The Body
- **One idea per email** — Don't try to cover everything
- **Conversational tone** — Write like you're emailing a smart friend
- **Short paragraphs** — 2-3 sentences max
- **Specificity** — Concrete details beat abstract claims

### The Close
- **Single CTA** — Don't give multiple options
- **Natural transition** — CTA should feel like logical next step
- **PS line** — Often most-read part after subject line

## Subject Lines

**Rules:**
- Under 50 characters (mobile-friendly)
- Curiosity or benefit, not clickbait
- Lowercase often outperforms Title Case
- Personal beats promotional

**Examples:**
- ✅ "the slide that got her promoted"
- ✅ "why I stopped using pie charts"
- ✅ "a question about your last presentation"
- ❌ "5 AMAZING Tips to TRANSFORM Your Presentations!"
- ❌ "SlideHeroes Newsletter #47"

## Sequence Guidelines

### Welcome Sequence (New Subscribers)
- Email 1: Deliver promised value + set expectations
- Email 2: Share origin story / why SlideHeroes exists
- Email 3: Address biggest pain point
- Email 4-5: Provide value, build relationship
- Email 6: Soft introduction to DDM course

### Campaign Sequences
- **Length:** 3-8 emails depending on offer
- **Spacing:** 2-3 days between emails (adjust based on urgency)
- **Arc:** Problem → Agitation → Story → Solution → Offer
- **Each email:** Standalone value even if they miss others

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Hook score ≥ 40/50
- [ ] Subject line < 50 chars
- [ ] Single clear CTA
- [ ] Sounds like Mike (not corporate)
- [ ] Provides standalone value
- [ ] No more than 3 links
- [ ] PS line included (if appropriate)
- [ ] Mobile-friendly (short paragraphs)

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "In this email I'm going to..." | Boring, breaks immersion |
| "As you know..." | Patronizing |
| Multiple CTAs | Confusing, reduces clicks |
| Walls of text | Won't get read on mobile |
| Generic openings | "Hope this finds you well" |
| Apologies for emailing | Undermines value |
| Clickbait that doesn't deliver | Breaks trust |

## Voice Reminders

Emails should sound like Mike:
- Expert but not arrogant
- Direct but not cold
- Generous but not desperate
- Contrarian but not negative

Read it aloud — does it sound like a real person wrote it?
