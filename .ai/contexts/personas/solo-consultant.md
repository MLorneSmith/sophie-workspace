## Summary

Independent consultants who create client deliverables and need to communicate complex recommendations clearly. They compete with big firms on quality of thinking, and presentations are how they prove their worth.

## Demographics

- **Role:** Independent consultant, freelance strategist, fractional executive
- **Experience:** 5-20+ years, often ex-Big 4 or corporate strategy
- **Company size:** Solo or small boutique (1-5 people)
- **Industry:** Management consulting, strategy, operations, finance, marketing
- **Location:** Major metros, increasingly remote
- **Income:** $150K-$500K+ annually

## Psychographics

### Goals
- Win and retain high-value clients
- Compete with larger firms on deliverable quality
- Build reputation for clear, executive-ready work
- Charge premium rates justified by output quality
- Spend more time on billable work, less on formatting

### Pain Points
- **"I spend 15-20 hours per pitch deck"** — Time that could be billable
- **"Generic presentation tips don't apply to my work"** — TED talk advice is useless in a boardroom
- **"My decks don't land the way McKinsey's do"** — Missing the polish and structure
- **"I know my content but struggle to structure it"** — Smart thinking, messy delivery
- **"Clients judge me by my deliverables"** — A bad deck undermines good advice

### Desires
- Credibility in the boardroom with senior stakeholders
- Professional-looking deliverables that match Big 4 quality
- Structured approach they can apply repeatedly
- Confidence when presenting to C-suite
- Time back from presentation creation

### Fears
- Looking unprofessional compared to larger competitors
- Losing deals because the deck didn't land
- Being seen as "just a freelancer" not a serious advisor
- Spending too much time on low-value formatting work

## Buying Behavior

### How They Find Us
- Google searches: "McKinsey presentation style," "consulting presentation template"
- LinkedIn content about presentations
- Referrals from other consultants
- Blog articles on specific presentation problems

### Decision Factors
- **Credibility:** Does this person actually know consulting presentations?
- **Practicality:** Can I use this tomorrow?
- **Time investment:** How long to see results?
- **ROI:** Will this help me win/retain clients?

### Objections
- "I already know how to present" → You know how to *speak*, not how to *structure*
- "I don't have time for a course" → You don't have time to keep losing deals
- "Templates are enough" → Templates without methodology = polished mediocrity

## Messaging That Resonates

### Hooks
- "Why your presentation skills are costing you clients"
- "The McKinsey structure your competitors are using"
- "Stop presenting topics. Start answering questions."
- "15 hours per deck → 5 hours per deck"

### Value Props
- "McKinsey-quality deliverables, solo consultant prices"
- "The methodology behind $500/hour consulting decks"
- "Win more pitches with structured, executive-ready presentations"

### Proof Points
- "Taught at Seneca College (Canada's largest community college)"
- "Used by US Department of Energy professionals"
- "Developed by ex-[Mike's background] with [X] years experience"

## Content Preferences

- **Format:** Practical how-tos, frameworks, examples
- **Tone:** Expert peer, not lecturer
- **Length:** Scannable, with depth available
- **Examples:** Real consulting situations, anonymized teardowns

## Scenario Examples (For Content Creation)

Use these scenarios to make content relatable and specific:

### Scenario 1: The Pitch That Didn't Land
> Sarah runs a boutique strategy practice. She spent 18 hours on a pitch deck for a mid-market PE firm. The meeting went fine — polite nods, "interesting approach." Then silence. She lost to a 3-person team from a Big 4 firm. When she got honest feedback, the PE partner said: "Your thinking was sharper. Their deck was clearer." She knew the methodology was the gap.

### Scenario 2: The CFO Who Pushed Back
> James is a fractional CFO advising three companies. In a board meeting, he presented his analysis of a potential acquisition. Halfway through, the lead director interrupted: "What's your actual recommendation?" James had buried the answer on slide 37. The analysis was solid. The structure lost the room.

### Scenario 3: The Template Trap
> David downloaded 15 "consulting-style" templates. His decks looked polished but felt empty. Clients complimented the design but asked probing questions his slides couldn't answer. Pretty labels instead of assertions. Charts without headlines that proved a point. He realized the gap wasn't design — it was thinking.

### When Writing For This Persona
- Reference specific deliverables: "pitch deck," "strategy review," "project update," "board presentation"
- Mention the competition: "the Big 4 team you're pitching against"
- Quantify time: "15 hours per deck," "2-day turnaround"
- Reference their clients: "your Fortune 500 client," "the PE partner," "the CEO"
- Acknowledge their expertise: "You know your content. The structure is the gap."

## Anti-Patterns (What Doesn't Work)

- Generic motivation ("You can do it!")
- Academic theory without application
- Consumer-focused presentation tips
- Anything that feels like "coaching" rather than "training"
- Talking down to them — they're experienced professionals, not beginners
- Ignoring the competitive dynamic — they're always competing against larger firms
