## Summary

Not everyone is a fit for SlideHeroes. These anti-personas help us avoid wasting effort on audiences who won't convert or won't succeed with our methodology.

---

## Anti-Persona 1: The Public Speaker

### Profile
Professional speakers, trainers, coaches who present from stages to large audiences.

### Why They're Not a Fit
- They need performance skills, not document structure
- Their "presentations" are speeches with visual aids
- TED-talk advice actually applies to them
- Different success metrics (applause, not decisions)

### Red Flags in Outreach
- "Keynote speaker," "TEDx," "conference presenter"
- Focus on audience engagement, stage presence
- Wants to "inspire" rather than "convince"

### What to Say If They Inquire
> "Our methodology is specifically for sit-down business presentations — boardroom decks, not stage performances. For keynote speaking, we'd recommend [alternative resource]."

---

## Anti-Persona 2: The Design-First Creator

### Profile
People who think presentation problems are design problems. Often in creative roles.

### Why They're Not a Fit
- They want prettier slides, not better arguments
- Will be frustrated by our structure-first approach
- Looking for templates and visual inspiration
- Don't believe "ugly but clear" beats "pretty but confusing"

### Red Flags in Outreach
- "Looking for templates," "design inspiration"
- Mentions Canva, Beautiful.ai, Prezi enthusiastically
- "How do I make my slides pop?"

### What to Say If They Inquire
> "We focus on structure and argument — the thinking behind the slides. If you're primarily looking for design help, tools like Canva or Beautiful.ai might be a better starting point."

## Anti-Persona 3: The Occasional Presenter

### Profile
People who present maybe 1-2 times per year. Not a core part of their job.

### Why They're Not a Fit
- ROI doesn't justify the investment
- Won't practice enough to internalize methodology
- Better served by one-off templates or quick tips
- Our depth is overkill for their needs

### Red Flags in Outreach
- "I have a presentation coming up" (singular)
- "Just need something quick"
- Presenting is clearly not part of their regular work

### What to Say If They Inquire
> "Our course is designed for professionals who present regularly. For a one-off presentation, our free blog resources might give you what you need faster."

## Anti-Persona 4: The Student/Academic

### Profile
University students or academics presenting research in academic settings.

### Why They're Not a Fit
- Academic presentations have different conventions
- No budget (or shouldn't spend limited budget here)
- Context (thesis defense, conference papers) is different
- Our corporate focus won't translate well

### Red Flags in Outreach
- Student email addresses
- "Thesis," "dissertation," "research presentation"
- Academic institution context

### What to Say If They Inquire
> "Our training is focused on corporate/business presentations. Academic presentations have different conventions — your university likely has resources specifically for research presentations."

## Anti-Persona 5: The "Just Give Me AI" Seeker

### Profile
People who want AI to do all the thinking. Looking for magic buttons.

### Why They're Not a Fit
- Want automation, not education
- Will be disappointed our AI doesn't replace thinking
- Looking for shortcuts, not skills
- Won't engage with methodology

### Red Flags in Outreach
- "Can AI just create my presentation?"
- "I don't want to learn, I want it done"
- Frustrated that tools require input

### What to Say If They Inquire
> "AI can accelerate presentation creation, but the strategic thinking — structure, argument, emphasis — has to come from you. We teach that thinking. If you're looking for fully automated creation, that's not what we offer."

## Using Anti-Personas

1. **In lead qualification:** Filter out before spending outreach effort
2. **In content creation:** Don't accidentally write to these audiences
3. **In objection handling:** Recognize when someone isn't a fit
4. **In positioning:** Define ourselves by who we're NOT for

## The Polite Redirect

When someone from an anti-persona inquires, be helpful:
- Acknowledge their need is valid
- Explain why we're not the best fit
- Suggest an alternative if possible
- Leave the door open if their situation changes
