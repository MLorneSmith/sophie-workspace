## Summary

Small consulting firms (2-20 people) that need consistent, professional deliverables across their team. They compete on quality of thinking and presentation, not scale.

## Demographics

- **Company size:** 2-20 consultants
- **Structure:** Partner(s) + associates/analysts
- **Revenue:** $500K - $10M annually
- **Industry focus:** Strategy, operations, finance, HR, IT consulting
- **Location:** Major metros, often serving regional or mid-market clients
- **Typical titles:** Managing Partner, Principal, Senior Consultant

## Psychographics

### Goals
- Deliver McKinsey-quality work without McKinsey overhead
- Build reputation that wins repeat business and referrals
- Train junior staff efficiently without partner time drain
- Create consistent "firm style" across all deliverables
- Scale the business without diluting quality

### Pain Points
- **"Our deliverables are inconsistent"** — Partner decks look different from associate decks
- **"I spend too much time fixing junior work"** — Redoing instead of reviewing
- **"We can't afford Big 4 training programs"** — $50K+ for one workshop
- **"New hires don't know how to structure arguments"** — Smart but untrained
- **"Clients compare us to McKinsey"** — Unfair but real

### Desires
- Scalable training that works without partner involvement
- Consistent framework everyone follows
- Junior staff who can produce client-ready work faster
- Competitive advantage through deliverable quality
- More time for client work, less for internal training

### Fears
- Losing deals to larger competitors on "polish"
- Client perception of being "small time"
- Key person dependency (only partners can do quality work)
- Training investment that doesn't stick

## Buying Behavior

### Decision Makers
- Managing Partner / Founder (budget authority)
- Often influenced by senior consultants who do the work

### Decision Process
1. Partner recognizes quality inconsistency problem
2. Searches for training solutions
3. Evaluates: cost, time investment, practical applicability
4. Often wants to try individually before team rollout
5. ROI justification: "If this saves 5 hours per deck across 10 consultants..."

### Budget
- Individual licenses: Easy approval ($200-500)
- Team licenses: Needs business case ($2,000-10,000)
- Compared to: Big 4 training ($50K+), hiring experienced consultants ($150K+ salary)

### Objections
- "We already have our own style" → Style without methodology = inconsistent execution
- "Our people are too busy for training" → 4 hours now saves 40 hours per quarter
- "Can't we just use templates?" → Templates without training = polished mediocrity

## Messaging That Resonates

### Hooks
- "Why your associate decks don't look like your partner decks"
- "The hidden cost of fixing junior work"
- "McKinsey training at boutique prices"
- "Stop redoing. Start reviewing."

### Value Props
- "Consistent deliverable quality across your entire team"
- "Train once, benefit on every engagement"
- "The methodology behind $500/hour consulting decks"

### Proof Points
- "Used by consulting teams at [clients]"
- "4 hours of training → 5+ hours saved per deliverable"
- "Institutional curriculum at Seneca College"

## Team vs. Individual Pitch

| Individual | Team |
|------------|------|
| "Level up your own skills" | "Level up your entire firm" |
| Personal career investment | Business capability investment |
| $X one-time | $X × seats, volume discount |
| Self-paced | Can include group coaching |

## Scenario Examples (For Content Creation)

### Scenario 1: The Inconsistency Problem
> Marcus, Managing Partner of a 12-person strategy boutique, just lost a follow-up engagement because the client compared his associate's deck to a McKinsey deliverable — and his looked amateur in comparison. The analysis was on par. The packaging wasn't. He realized he'd been fixing junior decks himself for years but never systematized the approach.

### Scenario 2: The Training Investment Dilemma
> A 6-person consultancy spent $35K sending two associates to a Big 4 "presentation skills" workshop. They came back with public speaking tips — eye contact, voice projection, confident posture. Zero impact on deliverable quality. The partner said: "I don't need them to speak better. I need them to WRITE better."

### Scenario 3: The Scale Problem
> Rachel's firm grew from 4 to 15 people in 18 months. Quality cratered. Every deck from a new hire required a complete rewrite by a partner. They were spending more time on internal quality control than client work. They needed a methodology everyone could follow, not tribal knowledge from the founding partners.

### When Writing For This Persona
- Reference the team dynamic: "your associates," "partner review time," "firm-wide consistency"
- Quantify the business impact: "$35K for training that didn't work," "5 hours saved per deliverable per consultant"
- Mention the scaling challenge: "what worked at 4 people breaks at 15"
- Compare to Big 4 alternatives: "McKinsey training costs $50K+. Ours costs a fraction."
- Address the partner's time: "Stop redoing. Start reviewing."

## Content Preferences

- **Format:** Case studies, before/after examples, ROI calculators
- **Tone:** Business peer, professional
- **Proof:** Other consulting firms, measurable outcomes
- **Concerns:** Time to value, ease of implementation
