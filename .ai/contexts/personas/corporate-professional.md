## Summary

Mid-level corporate employees who present to executives regularly. Their career advancement depends on visibility, and presentations are how they get noticed — or overlooked.

## Demographics

- **Role:** Manager, Senior Manager, Director, VP
- **Experience:** 5-15 years
- **Company size:** 500+ employees (enterprise)
- **Industries:** Finance, tech, consulting, healthcare, manufacturing
- **Function:** Strategy, operations, finance, marketing, product
- **Location:** Corporate HQ or major office locations

## Psychographics

### Goals
- Get promoted to the next level
- Build executive presence and visibility
- Influence decisions above their pay grade
- Be seen as "leadership material"
- Deliver results AND communicate them effectively

### Pain Points
- **"I do great work but don't get recognized"** — Results without visibility
- **"Presenting to execs terrifies me"** — High stakes, high anxiety
- **"My slides are walls of text"** — Know it's wrong, don't know how to fix it
- **"I wasn't trained for this"** — MBA didn't cover real-world presenting
- **"My boss keeps rewriting my decks"** — Demoralizing, time-consuming

### Desires
- Confidence in front of senior leadership
- Presentations that advance their ideas (and careers)
- Recognition for clear thinking, not just hard work
- The "secret" to how executives communicate
- Escape the cycle of deck rewrites

### Fears
- Looking unprepared or junior in front of leadership
- Career plateau due to poor communication
- Being passed over for promotion
- The moment when an exec says "what's your point?"

## Buying Behavior

### Decision Context
- Often self-funded (personal development budget or out of pocket)
- Sometimes expensed to L&D budget if available
- May need manager approval for time, not always for cost

### Decision Triggers
- Upcoming high-stakes presentation (board meeting, exec review)
- Performance review feedback about communication
- Watching a peer get promoted who "presents well"
- New role with more executive exposure

### Decision Factors
- **Time:** "Can I fit this around my job?"
- **Credibility:** "Does this person understand corporate life?"
- **Applicability:** "Will this work for MY presentations?"
- **Discretion:** May not want to advertise they need help

### Objections
- "I don't have time" → You don't have time to keep getting passed over
- "I'm not that bad" → Your competition is getting better
- "My company should pay" → This is a career investment in YOU

## Messaging That Resonates

### Hooks
- "The skill that determines who gets promoted"
- "Why your boss keeps rewriting your decks"
- "What executives actually want to see"
- "The presentation that changed my career"

### Value Props
- "Executive-ready presentation skills for mid-level professionals"
- "Stop being edited. Start being trusted."
- "The communication skills your MBA didn't teach"

### Proof Points
- "Used by professionals at [Fortune 500 companies]"
- "Developed with methodology from top consulting firms"
- "Join hundreds of professionals who've leveled up"

## Content Preferences

- **Format:** Quick wins, practical techniques, relatable scenarios
- **Tone:** Mentor/coach, empathetic to corporate realities
- **Length:** Respect for limited time — scannable, actionable
- **Examples:** Corporate situations (board meetings, exec reviews, project updates)

## Scenario Examples (For Content Creation)

### Scenario 1: The Career-Defining Moment
> Lisa, a Senior Manager in Corporate Strategy, was asked to present the annual strategic review to the CEO and executive committee. She'd never presented at this level. Her usual approach — 40 dense slides with every data point — would get her destroyed. She needed to learn how to create executive-level content in 3 weeks.

### Scenario 2: The Rewrite Cycle
> Tom, a Director of Product, spent every Sunday night rewriting his weekly update for the VP. He knew the content cold, but his boss would restructure the entire deck before sharing it up. After the third time, he overheard: "Tom does great analysis. I just wish he could package it." That comment kept him up at night.

### Scenario 3: The Invisible Performer
> Priya delivered consistently strong results but kept getting passed over for VP. Her performance reviews always said the same thing: "Needs to improve executive presence." She realized the people getting promoted weren't better at the job — they were better at communicating about the job.

### When Writing For This Persona
- Reference corporate power dynamics: "presenting to the C-suite," "the executive committee," "your skip-level"
- Mention career stakes: "the presentation that determines your promotion," "visibility with leadership"
- Acknowledge the politics: "your boss rewriting your work," "colleagues who 'present well' getting ahead"
- Reference familiar situations: "quarterly business reviews," "strategy updates," "project status meetings"
- Validate their expertise: "Your work is solid. The gap is communication, not content."

## Anti-Patterns (What Doesn't Work)

- Anything that feels like "remedial" training — they're capable professionals
- Academic theory without corporate application
- Advice that ignores corporate politics and power dynamics
- Tone that talks down to them
- Ignoring the self-funding reality — many buy this themselves
- Overemphasizing "public speaking" anxiety — this is about *deck creation*, not stage fright
