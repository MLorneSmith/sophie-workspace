## Summary

SlideHeroes is the McKinsey of presentation training — rigorous methodology for business professionals who need to communicate complex ideas to executives and decision-makers. Evolving from course to AI-powered platform.

## Positioning Statement

**For** corporate professionals, consultants, and entrepreneurs  
**Who** need to create compelling business presentations for executive audiences  
**SlideHeroes is** presentation methodology training (and soon, an AI-powered creation platform)  
**That** teaches McKinsey-style structured communication  
**Unlike** public speaking courses, design tools, or AI template generators  
**We** focus on the substance, structure, and argument quality of sit-down business presentations.

## Category

**Primary:** Professional skills training (presentations) → evolving to AI-powered presentation creation  
**Adjacent:** Business communication, consulting skills, executive presence  
**NOT in:** Public speaking, graphic design, general productivity tools

## Market Opportunity

### Why Now
1. **AI is democratizing creation, but not quality** — Anyone can generate slides with AI. Few can generate *good* slides. The thinking gap is widening.
2. **Remote/hybrid work increased presentation frequency** — More decisions happen via deck, fewer via in-person conversation. Stakes are higher.
3. **Consulting methodology has always been gated** — Only people who worked at McKinsey/BCG/Bain learned this. We're making it accessible.
4. **Existing tools miss the point** — Canva, Gamma, Tome optimize for speed and design. Nobody optimizes for argument quality.

### Market Gaps We Fill
| Gap | Who Has It | Our Solution |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| "Tips don't work for boardroom decks" | Solo consultants, corporate professionals | Consulting methodology training |
| "My team's deliverables are inconsistent" | Boutique consultancies | Standardized methodology + training |
| "AI decks look generic and unfocused" | Anyone using AI for presentations | Methodology-informed AI generation |
| "I wasn't trained for executive presentations" | Corporate mid-career professionals | Structured learning path |

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
| Competitor | Their Focus | Our Differentiation | Their Strength |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Toastmasters** | Public speaking practice | We're about structure, not stage presence | Strong community, brand recognition |
| **Duarte** | Design-forward presentations | We're methodology-first, design second | Beautiful visual content, strong brand |
| **Beautiful.ai** | AI design tools | We teach thinking, not just formatting | Slick product, ease of use |
| **Canva** | Easy design for everyone | We're not a tool, we're methodology + tools | Massive market reach, freemium model |
| **Gamma** | AI-powered presentation creation | We embed consulting methodology, not just templates | First-mover in AI presentations |
| **Tome** | AI storytelling for presentations | We focus on business rigor, not storytelling | Strong brand, VC-backed |
| **Generic "presentation tips"** | Surface-level advice | We go deep on consulting methodology | SEO volume, easy consumption |

### Indirect Competitors
- **Books** (Minto, Tufte, Duarte) — Great theory, but no application support
- **YouTube tutorials** — Free, but shallow and delivery-focused
- **Corporate L&D programs** — Expensive, inconsistent quality
- **MBA communication courses** — Academic, limited practical application
- **Freelance presentation designers** — They do it FOR you, we teach you to do it YOURSELF

### Competitive Moats
1. **Methodology depth** — Most competitors don't have a coherent framework. We have 5S, SCQ, MECE.
2. **Institutional validation** — Seneca College, US DoE. Hard to replicate.
3. **Practitioner credibility** — Mike's background is real and relevant.
4. **Content library** — Years of blog content teaching the methodology (SEO value).
5. **AI + methodology combination** — Nobody else is combining consulting methodology with AI creation tools.

## Key Differentiators

*(Detailed in `company/differentiators.md`)*

### 1. Sit-Down Focus
We teach boardroom presentations, not keynotes. This is a fundamentally different skill.

### 2. Consulting Methodology
Our approach comes from the consulting world — McKinsey, BCG, Bain — not the speaking circuit.

### 3. Structure Over Style
We spend more time on argument structure than slide design. Pretty slides don't save bad thinking.

### 4. Practical Frameworks
Everything we teach can be applied immediately. No theory without application.

### 5. AI + Methodology (Emerging)
Our AI tools don't just generate slides — they apply the same principles DDM teaches. Methodology-informed creation.

## Taglines & Hooks

**Primary Tagline:** "Slay your presentation audiences"  
**Website Headline:** "High-Stakes Presentation Training"

**Alternate Hooks:**
- "McKinsey-style presentation training for professionals"
- "Business presentations that actually land"
- "The methodology behind world-class decks"
- "Stop presenting. Start convincing."
- "The presentation skills your MBA didn't teach"
- "Structure beats style. Every time."

## Positioning by Audience

### For Solo Consultants
"Deliverables that compete with Big 4 quality — at solo prices"

### For Corporate Professionals  
"The presentation skills that get you promoted"

### For Boutique Consultancies
"Consistent, executive-ready deliverables across your entire team"

### For Entrepreneurs
"Pitch decks that get meetings — and close deals"

## What We Stand Against

These are the contrarian positions that define us. Use them in content for differentiation and engagement:

- **TED-talk worship** — Boardrooms aren't stages. The skills that make you a great keynote speaker will get you fired in a strategy review.
- **Design-first thinking** — Pretty doesn't mean persuasive. A beautifully designed deck with a bad argument still loses.
- **Generic tips** — "Make eye contact" doesn't help you structure an argument. "Use fewer words" doesn't tell you WHICH words.
- **Presentation theater** — Business is not performance art. Your CFO doesn't want to be inspired. They want to be convinced.
- **AI magic thinking** — "Just let AI do it" produces fast garbage. Methodology + AI produces fast *quality*.

## The One-Liner Test

If someone asks "What does SlideHeroes do?":

**Short:** "We teach professionals how to create McKinsey-quality business presentations."

**Medium:** "We provide presentation methodology training for professionals who present to executives and decision-makers — the McKinsey-style, boardroom-first approach that most presentation advice completely ignores."

**Long:** "Most presentation advice is actually public speaking advice — how to stand on a stage and inspire. That's useless in a boardroom. SlideHeroes teaches the methodology that top consulting firms use to create compelling, structured, evidence-backed presentations. We're also building AI tools that embed this methodology into the creation process."
