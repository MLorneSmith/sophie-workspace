## Value Prop Testing

### Does it pass the "So What?" Test?
After reading the value prop, can the reader answer:
- Why should I care?
- What will be different?
- Why you vs. alternatives?

### Does it pass the "Prove It" Test?
Can we back up this claim with:
- A case study?
- A testimonial?
- A logical argument?
- Data?

### Does it differentiate?
Could a competitor say the same thing?
- If yes → too generic
- If no → might be ownable
