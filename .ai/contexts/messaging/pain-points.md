## Summary

The problems our audience faces, organized by intensity and frequency. Use these to craft hooks, identify angles, and ensure content addresses real needs.

## Universal Pain Points (All Personas)

### 1. "Most presentation advice doesn't apply to me"
**Intensity:** High  
**Frequency:** Every time they seek help

> "I Googled 'presentation tips' and got advice about eye contact and hand gestures. I need to know how to structure a 40-page deck for the CFO."

**Hook angles:**
- "Why TED talk advice will get you fired in a boardroom"
- "The presentation tips that actually apply to business"

### 2. "I know my content but can't structure it"
**Intensity:** High  
**Frequency:** Every major presentation

> "I understand the problem, I have the data, but when I try to put it together it's a mess. The logic doesn't flow."

**Hook angles:**
- "Smart thinking, messy delivery: the consultant's curse"
- "The structure that makes complex arguments click"

### 3. "My presentations don't land"
**Intensity:** Very High  
**Frequency:** After key failures

> "I presented to the board and could see their eyes glaze over. I lost them halfway through. I don't know what went wrong."

**Hook angles:**
- "Why your presentation lost the room (and how to get them back)"
- "The moment executives stop listening"

### 4. "I spend too much time on presentations"
**Intensity:** Medium-High  
**Frequency:** Ongoing frustration

> "I spent 15 hours on that deck. My competitor probably spent 3. There has to be a better way."

**Hook angles:**
- "15 hours per deck → 5 hours per deck"
- "Where presentation time actually goes (and how to cut it)"

### 5. "My slides look unprofessional"
**Intensity:** Medium  
**Frequency:** Ongoing insecurity

> "I know it's not about design, but my slides look amateurish compared to what I see from consultancies."

**Hook angles:**
- "Why your slides look 'off' (it's not the template)"
- "The design rules consultants actually follow"

## Pain Point Intensity Ladder

Use this to match content to emotional state:

| Level | State | Content Need |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 5 - Crisis | "I just bombed a major presentation" | Immediate tactical fix, empathy |
| 4 - Urgent | "I have a board meeting in 2 weeks" | Practical framework, quick wins |
| 3 - Motivated | "I want to get better at this" | Comprehensive methodology |
| 2 - Curious | "I wonder if there's a better way" | Insight, contrast with status quo |
| 1 - Unaware | "Presentations are fine, not great" | Wake-up call, reframe the problem |

## Pain Points We DON'T Address

- Stage fright / public speaking anxiety (not our focus)
- Keynote / conference speaking
- Webinar presentation skills
- Design software training (Keynote, PowerPoint how-to)
- Presentation delivery coaching (voice, body language)

These are adjacent but not our lane. Mentioning them = scope creep.
