## Summary

Common objections and how to address them. Use these in email sequences (preemptively), outbound follow-ups, and sales conversations.

---

## Price Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Reframe:** Compare to the cost of the problem, not the cost of alternatives.

**Response:**
> "How much is a lost deal worth? A missed promotion? If one presentation lands better because of this training, what's the ROI?"

**For teams:**
> "Compare this to what McKinsey charges for a single workshop ($50K+), or the cost of a senior hire who 'just knows' presentations. This is training you own forever."

---

### "I can find free content online"

**Acknowledge & differentiate:**

**Response:**
> "You absolutely can — we give away a lot of it ourselves. Free content teaches concepts. The course gives you a structured methodology, practice framework, and the 1,000+ slide template. It's the difference between reading about cooking and actually learning to cook."

---

## Time Objections

### "I don't have time for a course"

**Reframe:** Address the time cost of NOT learning.

**Response:**
> "You don't have time to keep spending 15 hours on decks that should take 5. The course is ~4 hours. That's less time than you'll save on your next two presentations."

**Alternative:**
> "It's self-paced — most people do 30 minutes at a time between meetings. No need to block a full day."

---

### "I'm too busy right now — maybe later"

**Create urgency without pressure:**

**Response:**
> "Totally get it. But you'll always be busy. The question is whether you'll be busy doing things the hard way or the right way. Your next big presentation is coming regardless."

---

## Skill Objections

### "I already know how to present"

**Agree, then elevate:**

**Response:**
> "I'd guess you do — you've probably been doing it for years. The question is: are your presentations as crisp as the best decks you've seen from McKinsey or BCG? Most people present fine. Few present at an executive level."

---

### "I've taken presentation training before"

**Differentiate:**

**Response:**
> "Most presentation training is about delivery — confidence, body language, voice. We focus on the deck itself — structure, argument, evidence. The stuff that determines whether your presentation actually works, not just whether you look confident giving it."

---

### "I'm not that bad"

**Challenge gently:**

**Response:**
> "You might not be bad. But is 'not bad' where you want to be? Your competitors aren't settling for 'not bad.' Neither are the people getting promoted ahead of you."

---

## Need Objections

### "My presentations are fine"

**Plant doubt:**

**Response:**
> "When's the last time someone gave you honest feedback? Most people won't tell you your deck is confusing. They'll just tune out, or agree in the meeting and then not do what you asked."

---

### "This isn't a priority right now"

**Connect to their actual priorities:**

**Response:**
> "What IS a priority? Winning that deal? Getting that promotion? Convincing the board? Those things all run through presentations. This isn't separate from your priorities — it's how you achieve them."

---

### "My company should pay for this"

**Reframe as personal investment:**

**Response:**
> "They might. Worth asking. But think of it this way: your company benefits from your skills while you work there. You benefit from them your entire career. This is an investment in YOU."

---

## Trust Objections

### "How do I know this will work?"

**Offer proof and reduce risk:**

**Response:**
> "Three ways: (1) Look at who else uses this — Seneca College made it core curriculum, US Dept of Energy trains with it. (2) Try our free content first — the blog and Accelerator Kit give you a real taste. (3) 30-day money-back guarantee — if it doesn't work for you, you pay nothing."

---

### "I've been burned by courses before"

**Acknowledge and differentiate:**

**Response:**
> "Most online courses are someone's random thoughts packaged into videos. This is institutional-grade curriculum — the same methodology we use to train teams at major organizations. But I get the skepticism. That's why there's a guarantee."

---

## Format Objections

### "I prefer in-person training"

**Highlight benefits of online:**

**Response:**
> "In-person is great — if you have $10K+ and two days to give up. Online means you can learn at your pace, revisit sections when you need them, and apply it to real work in real time. Most people find they actually learn more because they can practice immediately."

---

### "I learn better from books"

**Acknowledge, then compare:**

**Response:**
> "If you want books, read Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle and Edward Tufte's work — they're foundational. Our course takes those principles and makes them practical and visual. It's the applied version of what books teach conceptually."
