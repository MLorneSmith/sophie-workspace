## Summary

A structured framework for planning, organizing, and executing SlideHeroes content across all channels. The calendar balances consistency with flexibility, ensures pillar coverage, and supports our SaaS transition.

---

## Calendar Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
1. **Consistency over intensity** — Regular publishing beats occasional brilliance
2. **Quality > quantity** — Skip a day if nothing worth saying
3. **Audience-first** — Schedule around when they read, not when we write
4. **Pillar balance** — Ensure all 4 pillars get regular coverage
5. **Cross-channel amplification** — Every major piece of content works across channels

**What the calendar does:**
- Ensures regular publishing cadence
- Balances content types and pillars
- Coordinates campaigns and launches
- Provides flexibility for timely content
- Tracks performance for optimization

**What the calendar doesn't do:**
- Force content when there's nothing valuable to say
- Lock us into rigid templates
- Prevent spontaneous/real-time content
- Replace editorial judgment

## Flexible / Agile Content

### What Can Break the Schedule

**Timely Opportunities:**
- Major news in AI/presentations space
- Viral discussion on LinkedIn (comment with our perspective)
- New tool launches (comparison, analysis)
- Real-world deck teardowns from current events

**Response-Driven Content:**
- Common questions from comments/emails
- Feedback on previous content (follow-up posts)
- Objections from prospects (address through content)
- Customer success stories (quick turnaround for fresh case studies)

### Rules for Breaking Schedule
- If content is genuinely time-sensitive and valuable → Post now, reschedule calendar content
- If just a "nice to have" topic → Add to idea backlog, keep calendar
- If inspired with a great idea → Write it, schedule later if needed

---

## Cross-Channel Coordination

### How Content Flows Across Channels

**Blog Post Lifecycle:**
1. Write and publish blog post (Tuesday)
2. Email newsletter mentions/references post (same week or next)
3. LinkedIn post summarizes key insight (Thursday or Friday)
4. Social media shares link with commentary (Wednesday-Saturday)
5. Add to relevant email nurture sequence
6. Reference in future content (internal linking)

**Case Study Lifecycle:**
1. Document success story
2. Publish as blog post
3. Create LinkedIn summary post
4. Reference in sales materials
5. Use in outbound emails as proof
6. Add to testimonial bank

**Campaign Content:**
1. Pillar content establishes methodology relevance
2. Problem-solving content agitates pain
3. AI + methodology content positions solution
4. Career impact content shows value
5. All coordinated across channels with campaign-specific messaging

### Calendar Optimization

Based on metrics, adjust:

---

## Seasonal Adjustments

### Slow Periods (August, December)
- Maintain minimum cadence (1 blog, 1 email/week)
- Fewer LinkedIn posts (quality over quantity)
- Use evergreen content updates instead of new content
- Focus on planning for next quarter

### High-Activity Periods (January, September)
- Increase content frequency
- Focus on career/beginnings-of-year themes
- Capitalize on "new year" resolutions and back-to-work energy
- Launch campaigns in these months

---

## Content Calendar Access & Management

**Where to Store:**
- Main calendar in project management tool (Asana, Notion, etc.)
- SEO calendar in content planning tool

## Anti-Patterns in Calendar Management

| Pattern | Why It's Bad | Alternative |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Publishing just to fill the calendar | Reduces quality, damages trust | Skip days if nothing valuable to say |
| Rigid templates that don't allow flexibility | Misses opportunities, feels robotic | Use templates as starting points, adapt |
| Ignoring performance data | Waste effort on what doesn't work | Review monthly, adjust based on metrics |
| Content in silos (no cross-channel coordination) | Misses amplification opportunities | Plan how each major piece works across channels |
| Only evergreen content | Misses timely engagement and SEO opportunities | Balance evergreen with timely, responsive content |
