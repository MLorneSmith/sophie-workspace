## Nurture Sequences

Campaign-specific email series that move subscribers toward a conversion action (course purchase, demo booking, etc.). Sequences have an arc: problem → agitation → story → solution → offer.

### Template: 6-Email Welcome Sequence

| Email | Purpose | Content |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Deliver value + set expectations | What they signed up for, what to expect |
| 2 | Origin story | Why SlideHeroes exists, Mike's background |
| 3 | Address biggest pain point | Deep dive on their #1 problem |
| 4 | Value drop | Complete framework or technique |
| 5 | Another pain point + solution | Different angle, build trust |
| 6 | Soft offer introduction | Here's a solution if you want to go deeper |

### Template: Problem-Solution Sequence (5 emails)

| Email | Purpose | Content |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Hook with problem | Identify a presentation problem they face |
| 2 | Agitate the problem | Show the cost/impact of not fixing it |
| 3 | Story + empathy | "I've seen this hundreds of times" |
| 4 | Solution teaser | Here's what actually works (methodology preview) |
| 5 | Full solution + offer | Complete framework + CTA to course/product |

### Sequence Voice
- Conversational, like continuing a conversation
- Each email stands alone (they might miss one)
- Open loops create anticipation for next email
- No "in this sequence I'll teach you..." — just deliver

[Personalization hook - first 10 words, specific]

[Context - 40-80 words, show you understand their world]

[CTA - binary, low-commitment, time-bound optional]
```

### Template: Follow-Up

```
**Subject:** [40 chars max, lowercase, reference topic]

[Add value - new insight, not just checking in]

[Connect to their situation]

[CTA - same low-friction ask]
```

[Short paragraph with the main point]

[Optional: bullet points if listing, max 3-5]

```
[Hook - specific rule or observation]

[Context - why this matters]

[The technique - how to do it]

```

[The problem or insight]

[The lesson - actionable takeaway]
```

### LinkedIn Voice
- First-person ("I saw this...")

- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- Lots of white space
- Sometimes bold/contrarian
- Engagement prompts at end

### Quality Checklist
