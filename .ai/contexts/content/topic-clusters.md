## Summary

SEO keyword clusters organized by strategic theme. Each cluster represents a content pillar with related search terms that we can rank for. Clusters include primary keywords, supporting keywords, content ideas, and audience mapping.

---

## Cluster Strategy

**What are topic clusters?**
Content SEO organized around core themes ("pillar pages") with related articles ("cluster content") that link back to the pillar. This builds topical authority and helps Google understand our expertise.

**How we use them:**
- Pillar pages: Comprehensive guides on major topics
- Cluster content: Specific articles targeting long-tail keywords
- Internal linking: All cluster content links to pillar, pillar links to all cluster content
- Cross-linking: Clusters link to each other where relevant

**Our approach:**
- Focus on high-intent, business-relevant search terms
- Avoid generic "presentation tips" (too broad, wrong intent)
- Target consultants, corporate professionals, and entrepreneurs
- Build authority in "McKinsey-style business presentations"
