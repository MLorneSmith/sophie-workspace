## Summary

SlideHeroes teaches professionals how to create compelling McKinsey-style business presentations — and is building AI-powered tools to apply that methodology at scale. We focus on sit-down presentations around a boardroom table — not auditorium-style speeches.

## Company Direction

SlideHeroes is pivoting from a course-only business to an **AI-powered SaaS platform** for creating McKinsey-quality business presentations. The existing DDM course remains a cornerstone — it teaches the methodology. The SaaS product will embed that methodology into the creation process.

*(For product details, see `company/products.md`. For roadmap, see `company/roadmap.md`.)*

## Philosophy

We believe presentation writing skills are under-rated. They can have a profound effect on your career success.

The ability to write clear and impactful PowerPoint presentations is, for young and mid-level professionals, **one of the most valuable skills you can master**:

- PowerPoint/Keynote is the de facto paradigm for internal corporate communication today
- The ability to present ideas compellingly can be a key differentiator (frankly, many people are simply not very good at it)
- Strong communication skills make professionals more effective — they save time otherwise spent resolving miscommunication

**The problem:** Unless a professional lucks out early in their career and learns the craft from someone exceptional, their presentation skills are probably pretty poor.

SlideHeroes seeks to change that.

## Our Focus

### 1. Sit-down business presentations (not auditorium-style speeches)
The vast majority of business presentations are not made standing up in front of a crowd. They're made sitting down, around a table, updating a project team or presenting thinking/ideas/recommendations to the boss.

### 2. Creation of content (story, structure, logic, data) — not just delivery
The success of sit-down presentations relies on the clarity, crispness, and punch of the content on the page. Learning to *create*, not just *deliver*, is critical.

### 3. Mastery of a broad set of skills, not just one
Becoming exceptional at crafting board-level presentations is tough. It's a multi-disciplinary challenge requiring mastery of a SET of distinct skills:

- **The Art of Storytelling**
- **The Power of Logical Structure**  
- **The Science of Fact-based Persuasion**
- **The Harmony of Design**
- **The Drama of Performance**

## The SlideHeroes Difference

**What we're NOT:**
- TED-talk style presentation coaching
- Public speaking courses  
- Design-first tools (Canva, Beautiful.ai)
- Generic 'presentation tips' content

**What we ARE:**
- McKinsey presentation methodology
- Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle applied
- Edward Tufte's data visualization philosophy
- Consulting firm training — without the consulting firm
- Building AI tools that embed this methodology into the creation process

## Core Belief

> "Business presentations are NOT speeches. 'Sit-down' McKinsey-style business presentations around a board table are fundamentally different from public speaking and require a completely different approach to communication."

Most 'presentation tips' are actually speech tips — and they'll get you fired in a boardroom.

## Founder

**Mike** — The methodology behind SlideHeroes comes from decades at the intersection of strategy consulting and corporate leadership:

- **Mastercard** — Senior leader in Cyber & Intelligence Solutions / Enterprise Risk & Security. Deep expertise in payments, fraud/cybersecurity, identity/biometrics, strategy, M&A, standards, and device/application ecosystems.
- **Mastercard Advisors** — Payments consulting practice.
- **Lloyds Banking Group** — Strategy consulting.
- **Oliver Wyman** — Strategy consulting.
- **IBM** — Early career in direct marketing.
- **London Business School** — MBA (Strategy & Finance).
- **University of British Columbia** — B.Comm.

This background matters because Mike didn't learn presentations from books — he learned them by building hundreds of board-level decks for C-suite audiences across financial services, consulting, and technology. The methodology he teaches is what he *used*, not what he *read about*.

## Social Proof

**Institutional Partnerships:**
- **Seneca College** — Canada's largest community college. DDM is core curriculum in their business programs. This is institutional adoption, not a one-off workshop.
- **US Department of Energy** — Government professionals trained using our methodology.

**Customer Results:**
- Hundreds of satisfied customers across consulting, corporate, and entrepreneurial contexts
- Taught at major educational institutions
- Used by professionals who present to boards, C-suites, and investors regularly

**Why Partnerships Matter:**
Seneca didn't adopt DDM as a favor — they evaluated it against alternatives and chose it for their students. The DoE partnership demonstrates applicability beyond private sector. These are credibility markers that most competitors can't match.
