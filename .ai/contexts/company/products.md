### The 5S Framework

The course teaches the **5S Framework** — a comprehensive methodology covering every dimension of presentation excellence:

| Element | Description | Key Lesson |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Structure** | The backbone of clear communication — organizing your argument | "Answer a question, don't present a topic" |
| **Story** | The power of narrative to engage and persuade | Use SCQ (Situation, Complication, Question) for introductions |
| **Substance** | Evidence, data, and facts that demonstrate your points | "Demonstrate, don't simply assert" |
| **Style** | Visual design that enhances rather than distracts | "Headlines should be assertions, not labels" |
| **Self-Confidence** | Presence and delivery when presenting | "If your meeting is important enough for a presentation, it's important enough for a GREAT one" |

### Key Concepts Taught

1. **"Answer a question, don't present a topic"** — Rather than presenting about "Customer Relationship Management Software," answer the question "Our CRM software is old — does it need to be replaced?"

2. **"Demonstrate, don't assert"** — Use data, facts, and compelling logic. The "because I say so" argument doesn't work in boardrooms.

3. **Barbara Minto's SCQ Framework** — Situation, Complication, Question for structuring introductions that grip the audience immediately.

4. **MECE Principle** — Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. Limit lists to no more than 5 items. If more, bucket them one level of abstraction higher.

5. **Headlines as assertions** — Not "Q3 Revenue" but "Q3 Revenue exceeded forecast by 12%." Labels are lazy. Assertions show you've done the thinking.

6. **Data visualization discipline** — Match chart type to data relationship. Don't use pie charts. Ensure the data visually proves the headline's claim.

7. **"McKinsey-style"** — Shorthand for structured, evidence-based, executive-ready presentations.

### Pricing

*(Current pricing tiers TBD by Mike)*

### Differentiator

> Most presentation advice focuses on PUBLIC SPEAKING (TED talks, keynotes, stage performances). SlideHeroes focuses on SIT-DOWN BUSINESS PRESENTATIONS — the McKinsey-style decks you present around a boardroom table. These require a fundamentally different approach.

## Team Training

Designed for boutique consultancies and corporate teams that need consistent deliverable quality:

- **Online learning model** takes 40-50% less employee time to learn concepts (vs. traditional workshops)
- **Proven methodology** ensures consistency across team — partner decks and associate decks match
- **Optional small group, live coaching** to receive feedback on real-world work
- **Scalable** — train new hires without partner time drain

**Positioning vs. alternatives:**
| Us | Big 4 Training | In-House |
|----|----------------|----------|
| ~$X per seat | $50K+ per workshop | Partner's time (most expensive resource) |
| Self-paced, always available | One-off event | Inconsistent, key-person dependent |
| Proven methodology | Varies by facilitator | Often tribal knowledge |

## Free Resources (Lead Generation)

These serve both as value-first marketing and as credibility builders:

- **Presentation Accelerator Kit** — Comprehensive collection of all resources we've ever made. Primary lead magnet.
- **Advanced Guide to Business Presentations** — eBook covering core methodology
- **PowerPoint Template** — 1,000+ professionally designed slides. High perceived value.
- **Blog articles** — Deep-dive content on specific presentation techniques. SEO-driven. Foundation of our methodology (give away the *what*, course teaches the *how*).
- **Presentation reviews** — Detailed teardowns of real consultancy decks (BCG, etc.) published on the blog. Demonstrates expertise.

**Content strategy:** Our free content is better than most competitors' paid content. This is intentional. Generosity builds trust and authority.

## AI-Powered SaaS Platform (In Development)

*(See `company/roadmap.md` for full details)*

The next evolution of SlideHeroes: an AI platform that embeds our methodology into the presentation creation process.

**Key difference from other AI tools:** Most AI presentation tools optimize for speed and visual polish. Ours will optimize for *argument quality* — structure, logic, evidence. The methodology DDM teaches, applied by AI.

## Anti-Patterns (What We DON'T Offer)

- One-on-one speech coaching (not our format)
- Design services — we teach, not do
- Public speaking anxiety therapy (not our domain)
- Keynote/TED talk preparation (different skill set entirely)
- "Make it pretty" template-only solutions (design without methodology)

## For Content Agents

When referencing products:
- **DDM** can be used after first introducing "Decks for Decision Makers"
- Always mention the **5S Framework** when describing the course
- Reference **free resources** generously — don't gatekeep
- The AI SaaS can be teased ("we're building tools") but don't over-promise features
- **Seneca College** and **US DoE** are the strongest proof points for course quality
