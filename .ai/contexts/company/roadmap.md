# SlideHeroes Product Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-08
**Owner:** Mike
**Used By:** all content workflows, product-related comms
**Status:** Draft — awaiting Mike's review

---

## Summary

SlideHeroes is pivoting from a course-only business to an AI-powered SaaS platform for creating McKinsey-style business presentations. The existing DDM course becomes part of a broader product offering.

---

## Current State (February 2026)

### Live Products
- **Decks for Decision Makers (DDM)** — Online video course (flagship, revenue-generating)
- **Presentation Accelerator Kit** — Free resource collection (lead magnet)
- **Blog** — SEO-driven content on presentation methodology
- **PowerPoint Template** — 1,000+ professionally designed slides (free + course)

### Technology
- Product codebase: `2025slideheroes` (active development)
- AI presentation generation: In development
- Infrastructure: *(TBD by Mike)*

---

## The Pivot: Course → AI-Powered SaaS

### Why
The DDM course teaches *methodology*. But professionals also need *tools* that apply that methodology as they work. AI makes it possible to embed McKinsey-style thinking directly into the creation process.

### What's Changing
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| One-time course purchase | Subscription SaaS product |
| Learn methodology, apply manually | AI applies methodology during creation |
| Passive educational content | Active creation tool |
| Individual learning | Team collaboration potential |

### What Stays the Same
- The methodology (5S Framework, SCQ, MECE, structure-first)
- The philosophy (sit-down > stand-up, structure > design, demonstrate > assert)
- The existing course (becomes an upsell/complement)
- The audience (consultants, corporate professionals)

---

## Product Vision

> "An AI-powered platform that helps professionals create McKinsey-quality business presentations — applying the structure, logic, and evidence standards that DDM teaches, but embedded into the creation workflow."

### Core Capabilities (Planned)
1. **AI Presentation Generation** — Create structured presentations from prompts/briefs
2. **Methodology Enforcement** — AI applies SlideHeroes principles (headlines as assertions, MECE structure, evidence-backed claims)
3. **Template System** — Professional slide designs aligned with consulting standards
4. **Review & Feedback** — AI-powered deck review against SlideHeroes quality criteria

### Target Users
- **Individual:** Solo consultants, corporate professionals (self-serve)
- **Team:** Boutique consultancies wanting consistent quality across staff
- **Enterprise:** Larger organizations standardizing presentation quality

## Messaging Implications

### For Content Creation
When writing about SlideHeroes:
- **Present tense:** The course and training methodology
- **Future tense (careful):** AI-powered features not yet publicly available
- **Bridge:** "We teach the methodology AND build tools that apply it"

### What We Can Say Publicly (Now)
- SlideHeroes teaches McKinsey-style presentation skills ✅
- DDM course is available ✅
- We're building AI-powered tools ✅ (general — no specifics)

### What We Should NOT Say Publicly (Yet)
- Specific feature details of the SaaS product ❌
- Pricing for unreleased product ❌
- Timelines that could disappoint if missed ❌

---

## How This Informs Agent Output

When agents create content, they should:
1. **Lead with methodology** — the timeless principles, not the product
2. **Position SlideHeroes as the authority** — we know presentations better than anyone
3. **Tease the future** — "We're building tools to make this even easier"
4. **Never overpromise** — don't describe features that don't exist yet as if they do
