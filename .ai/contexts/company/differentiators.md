## Summary

What makes SlideHeroes genuinely different from every other presentation resource. These aren't marketing claims — they're real, defensible differentiators that should inform all content and positioning.

---

## The Big Three

### 1. Sit-Down Business Presentations (Not Speeches)

**What it means:** We focus exclusively on the type of presentation that happens around a boardroom table — strategy reviews, project updates, investment proposals, board meetings. NOT keynotes, NOT conference talks, NOT TED-style performances.

**Why it matters:** This is 95% of real business presentations, yet virtually all "presentation advice" is actually speech advice. The skills are fundamentally different:

| Sit-Down (Our Focus) | Stand-Up (Not Our Focus) |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Content on the page carries the argument | Presenter's delivery carries the argument |
| Slides are read and studied | Slides are backdrop |
| Structure and logic are paramount | Narrative and emotion are paramount |
| Audience scrutinizes data | Audience is swept along |
| Success = decisions made | Success = applause |
| Minutes to hours, dense information | 18 minutes, one big idea |

**Competitive advantage:** Almost nobody else makes this distinction. When they do, they're usually a full-service consultancy, not a training product.

**In content:** Always make the sit-down/stand-up distinction. It immediately signals expertise and filters for the right audience.

### 2. Consulting Methodology (Not Tips & Tricks)

**What it means:** Our approach comes directly from the consulting world — McKinsey, BCG, Bain. The 5S Framework, Pyramid Principle, MECE, SCQ. These aren't "tips" we collected from the internet. This is institutional knowledge from the top strategy firms.

**Why it matters:** There's a massive gap between "presentation tips" (make eye contact, use fewer words) and "presentation methodology" (structure your argument using MECE principles, make headlines assertions not labels, demonstrate don't assert). One is surface-level. The other is how professionals who charge $500/hour build decks.

**The intellectual lineage:**
- **Barbara Minto** — Pyramid Principle, SCQ Framework (developed at McKinsey)
- **Edward Tufte** — Data visualization principles, evidence-based persuasion
- **McKinsey/BCG/Bain** — The practical application of these principles in real client work
- **Mike's experience** — Decades applying these at Mastercard, consulting firms, and banking

**Competitive advantage:** Most competitors teach presentation *delivery*. We teach presentation *creation*. Most teach *how to present*. We teach *what to present and why*.

**In content:** Reference specific frameworks (5S, SCQ, MECE) by name. Show the methodology depth, not just surface advice.

### 3. Structure Over Style (Thinking Over Design)

**What it means:** We believe the #1 determinant of presentation success is the quality of the argument — its structure, logic, and evidence. Not the design. Not the delivery. The thinking.

**Why it matters:** The market is full of design-first tools (Canva, Beautiful.ai, Gamma) and delivery-first coaches (Toastmasters, speaking coaches). Nobody focuses on the actual *thinking* behind the presentation. That's where the real leverage is.

**The hierarchy:**
```
1. Structure — Is the argument logically organized? (Most important)
2. Substance — Is it backed by evidence and data?
3. Story — Does it have a compelling narrative arc?
4. Style — Does the design support the message?
5. Self-Confidence — Can the presenter deliver it well?
```

**Competitive advantage:** This inverts what most people assume. They think design = quality. We know structure = quality. This is contrarian, evidence-based, and immediately differentiating.

**In content:** Always lead with structure. When showing examples, comment on argument quality first, design second.

## Supporting Differentiators

### 4. Real-World Credentials

**What we have:**
- **Seneca College partnership** — Canada's largest community college made DDM core curriculum. This isn't a testimonial — it's institutional adoption.
- **US Department of Energy** — Government professionals trained with our methodology.
- **Mike's background** — Ex-Mastercard (Cyber & Intelligence Solutions), consulting (Oliver Wyman, Lloyds Banking Group), London Business School MBA. Not a "presentation coach" — a practitioner who lived this.

**Why it matters:** Most presentation training comes from speakers, coaches, or marketers. Our methodology comes from someone who *used* it at the highest levels of corporate strategy and M&A.

**In content:** Reference institutional partnerships (Seneca, DoE) as proof of methodological rigor, not just customer logos.

---

### 5. Generous Free Content

**What we do:** Blog posts that teach complete frameworks. Free templates. Free accelerator kits. We give away the methodology — the course is for depth, practice, and structured learning.

**Why it matters:** Most competitors gatekeep their best insights. We believe generosity builds trust, authority, and long-term customers. If our free content is better than competitors' paid content, we've already won.

**In content:** Don't hold back. Give the good stuff. The course sells itself when people realize they need structured learning, not just blog posts.

---

### 6. Practitioner Voice (Not Academic, Not Fluffy)

**What it means:** Mike's writing and teaching voice is that of an experienced practitioner — someone who has built hundreds of decks, reviewed thousands, and trained hundreds of professionals. It's not academic (no jargon soup), not motivational (no "believe in yourself"), and not generic (no "5 tips for better slides").

**Why it matters:** Our audience can smell inauthenticity. When a solo consultant reads our content, they should think "this person has been in the room I'm trying to get into."

**In content:** Always write from experience, not theory. Use phrases like "I've seen this a hundred times" and "here's what actually happens when..." — not "research suggests that..."

## How to Use This File

When creating content:
1. **Lead with a differentiator** — every piece should touch at least one
2. **Name the contrast** — "Unlike X, we..." is powerful positioning
3. **Be specific** — "McKinsey methodology" not "professional training"
4. **Let the audience self-select** — the sit-down/stand-up distinction filters perfectly
5. **Back claims with evidence** — partnerships, methodology sources, Mike's background

*Draft based on existing positioning and competitive analysis. Mike should validate competitive claims and add any differentiators I'm missing.*
