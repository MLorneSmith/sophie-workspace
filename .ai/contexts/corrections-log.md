- **Deliverable:** Blog post — "How to Structure a Boardroom Presentation"
- **Feedback (reviewer):** Missing SEO elements (internal links, external links, meta description, featured image alt text)
- **Context updated:** `guidelines/blog-guidelines.md` already covered these — builder agent didn't follow them closely enough. No context file change needed; issue was agent compliance, not context gap.
- **Action:** None (context was correct, execution was the gap)
