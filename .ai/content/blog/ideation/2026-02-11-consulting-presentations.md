## 🎯 Blog Topic Ideas

### #1: McKinsey Presentation Style Guide — How to Structure Slides Like a Top-3 Consultant
- **Primary keyword:** "mckinsey style presentation" (774 impr/mo in GSC, position 6.6)
- **Secondary keywords:** "mckinsey presentation style" (277 impr), "mckinsey powerpoint guidelines" (92 impr), "how to make mckinsey style presentation" (61 impr), "mckinsey slides" (250 impr)
- **Combined impressions:** ~1,400/mo across related queries
- **Angle:** Go beyond the existing teardown page — create a definitive how-to guide that teaches the actual McKinsey framework (pyramid principle, MECE, action titles) with before/after examples
- **Post type:** how-to
- **Target persona:** solo-consultant / boutique-consultancy
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Dedup check:** ⚠️ Related to `/mckinsey-business-presentations` (existing teardown). But this is a HOW-TO guide vs. the existing TEARDOWN — complementary, not duplicative. Link between them.

### #2: BCG Slide Deck Style — Lessons from Boston Consulting Group's Presentation Approach  
- **Primary keyword:** "bcg presentation" (450 impr/mo in GSC, position 8.0)
- **Secondary keywords:** "bcg slides" (442 impr), "bcg deck" (201 impr), "bcg slide deck" (199 impr), "bcg ppt" (130 impr), "bcg style presentation" (79 impr)
- **Combined impressions:** ~1,500/mo across related queries
- **Angle:** Expand beyond the existing teardown — a comprehensive guide to BCG's distinctive style (data-heavy, insight-driven headlines, structured arguments). Include comparison with McKinsey style.
- **Post type:** how-to
- **Target persona:** solo-consultant / boutique-consultancy
- **Score:** 8.5/10
- **Dedup check:** ⚠️ Related to `/presentation-review-bcg` (existing teardown). Same logic as #1 — this is the how-to companion piece. Cross-link.

### #3: Business Graphs & Charts — The Complete Guide to Data Visualization in Presentations
- **Primary keyword:** "business graph" (1,250 impr/mo in GSC, position 6.5)
- **Secondary keywords:** "business charts" (971 impr), "business graphs" (562 impr), "business charts and graphs" (138 impr), "chart business" (99 impr)
- **Combined impressions:** ~3,000/mo — highest volume cluster
- **Angle:** Go deeper than the existing typology page — practical guide with when-to-use-what decision framework, common mistakes, and industry-specific examples (finance vs. strategy vs. ops)
- **Post type:** how-to
- **Target persona:** solo-consultant / enterprise-presenter
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Dedup check:** ⚠️ Related to `/typology-business-charts` (existing page). But that page covers chart TYPES — this covers HOW TO USE THEM EFFECTIVELY. Complementary with internal linking.

### #4: Management Consulting Slide Deck Templates — What Actually Works
- **Primary keyword:** "management consulting slide deck" (390/mo from DataForSEO, LOW competition)
- **Secondary keywords:** "consulting slides" (390/mo), "consulting slide templates" (210/mo), "consulting slide deck examples" (170/mo), "consulting powerpoint templates" (260/mo)
- **Combined volume:** ~1,400/mo (DataForSEO data)
- **Angle:** Not just templates — teach WHY consulting decks are structured the way they are. Cover situation-complication-resolution, pyramid principle, action titles. Provide framework + downloadable structure.
- **Post type:** how-to / listicle hybrid
- **Target persona:** solo-consultant / boutique-consultancy
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Dedup check:** ✅ No direct overlap. Existing content covers specific firms (McKinsey, BCG) but not the general consulting template framework.

### #5: How to Overcome Stage Fright Before a Business Presentation
- **Primary keyword:** "stage fright presentation tips" (736 impr/mo in GSC combined queries, position 7.6)
- **Secondary keywords:** "do you get nervous delivering a speech" (386 impr, position 9.4)
- **Combined impressions:** ~1,100/mo
- **Angle:** The existing public-speaking-anxiety page gets 126 clicks/mo already — this is working content. A NEW post could target the specific "tips" and "how to overcome" intent with actionable techniques (not just "what is glossophobia"). Focus on business context specifically — board meetings, client presentations, all-hands.
- **Post type:** how-to
- **Target persona:** enterprise-presenter / solo-consultant
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Dedup check:** ⚠️ Related to `/public-speaking-anxiety` (existing, 35K impressions). Risk of cannibalization. **Recommendation:** Consider OPTIMIZING the existing page rather than creating new content. If creating new, must have clearly distinct angle (e.g., "5-minute pre-presentation routine" vs. general anxiety guide).

## ⚠️ DataForSEO Note
Balance depleted ($-0.05). Keyword volume data from earlier research session. Need top-up (~$10-20) for continued keyword research.
