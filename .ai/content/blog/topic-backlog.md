- **Current performance:** 11 clicks/mo, 4,764 impressions, position 10.7 (GSC 90d)
- **Angle:** Comprehensive guide to AI presentation tools in 2026, featuring SlideHeroes app prominently
- **Notes:** Existing post is outdated and doesn't mention SlideHeroes app. Complete rewrite, not an edit. Must reflect course→app pivot positioning.
- **Depends on:** #448 (app positioning discussion) — need updated product context before writing
