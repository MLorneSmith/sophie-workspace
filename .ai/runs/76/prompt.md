# SlideHeroes - Company Overview

## Summary

SlideHeroes teaches professionals how to create compelling McKinsey-style business presentations — and is building AI-powered tools to apply that methodology at scale. We focus on sit-down presentations around a boardroom table — not auditorium-style speeches.

## Company Direction

SlideHeroes is pivoting from a course-only business to an **AI-powered SaaS platform** for creating McKinsey-quality business presentations. The existing DDM course remains a cornerstone — it teaches the methodology. The SaaS product will embed that methodology into the creation process.

*(For product details, see `company/products.md`. For roadmap, see `company/roadmap.md`.)*

## Philosophy

We believe presentation writing skills are under-rated. They can have a profound effect on your career success.

The ability to write clear and impactful PowerPoint presentations is, for young and mid-level professionals, **one of the most valuable skills you can master**:

- PowerPoint/Keynote is the de facto paradigm for internal corporate communication today
- The ability to present ideas compellingly can be a key differentiator (frankly, many people are simply not very good at it)
- Strong communication skills make professionals more effective — they save time otherwise spent resolving miscommunication

**The problem:** Unless a professional lucks out early in their career and learns the craft from someone exceptional, their presentation skills are probably pretty poor.

SlideHeroes seeks to change that.

## Our Focus

### 1. Sit-down business presentations (not auditorium-style speeches)
The vast majority of business presentations are not made standing up in front of a crowd. They're made sitting down, around a table, updating a project team or presenting thinking/ideas/recommendations to the boss.

### 2. Creation of content (story, structure, logic, data) — not just delivery
The success of sit-down presentations relies on the clarity, crispness, and punch of the content on the page. Learning to *create*, not just *deliver*, is critical.

### 3. Mastery of a broad set of skills, not just one
Becoming exceptional at crafting board-level presentations is tough. It's a multi-disciplinary challenge requiring mastery of a SET of distinct skills:

- **The Art of Storytelling**
- **The Power of Logical Structure**  
- **The Science of Fact-based Persuasion**
- **The Harmony of Design**
- **The Drama of Performance**

## The SlideHeroes Difference

**What we're NOT:**
- TED-talk style presentation coaching
- Public speaking courses  
- Design-first tools (Canva, Beautiful.ai)
- Generic 'presentation tips' content

**What we ARE:**
- McKinsey presentation methodology
- Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle applied
- Edward Tufte's data visualization philosophy
- Consulting firm training — without the consulting firm
- Building AI tools that embed this methodology into the creation process

*(For detailed competitive differentiation, see `company/differentiators.md`.)*

## Core Belief

> "Business presentations are NOT speeches. 'Sit-down' McKinsey-style business presentations around a board table are fundamentally different from public speaking and require a completely different approach to communication."

Most 'presentation tips' are actually speech tips — and they'll get you fired in a boardroom.

## Founder

**Mike** — The methodology behind SlideHeroes comes from decades at the intersection of strategy consulting and corporate leadership:

- **Mastercard** — Senior leader in Cyber & Intelligence Solutions / Enterprise Risk & Security. Deep expertise in payments, fraud/cybersecurity, identity/biometrics, strategy, M&A, standards, and device/application ecosystems.
- **Mastercard Advisors** — Payments consulting practice.
- **Lloyds Banking Group** — Strategy consulting.
- **Oliver Wyman** — Strategy consulting.
- **IBM** — Early career in direct marketing.
- **London Business School** — MBA (Strategy & Finance).
- **University of British Columbia** — B.Comm.

This background matters because Mike didn't learn presentations from books — he learned them by building hundreds of board-level decks for C-suite audiences across financial services, consulting, and technology. The methodology he teaches is what he *used*, not what he *read about*.

## Social Proof

**Institutional Partnerships:**
- **Seneca College** — Canada's largest community college. DDM is core curriculum in their business programs. This is institutional adoption, not a one-off workshop.
- **US Department of Energy** — Government professionals trained using our methodology.

**Customer Results:**
- Hundreds of satisfied customers across consulting, corporate, and entrepreneurial contexts
- Taught at major educational institutions
- Used by professionals who present to boards, C-suites, and investors regularly

**Why Partnerships Matter:**
Seneca didn't adopt DDM as a favor — they evaluated it against alternatives and chose it for their students. The DoE partnership demonstrates applicability beyond private sector. These are credibility markers that most competitors can't match.

## Company Details

- **Website:** https://www.slideheroes.com
- **Tagline:** "Slay your presentation audiences" *(alternate: "High-Stakes Presentation Training")*

## Summary

SlideHeroes is the McKinsey of presentation training — rigorous methodology for business professionals who need to communicate complex ideas to executives and decision-makers. Evolving from course to AI-powered platform.

## Positioning Statement

**For** corporate professionals, consultants, and entrepreneurs  
**Who** need to create compelling business presentations for executive audiences  
**SlideHeroes is** presentation methodology training (and soon, an AI-powered creation platform)  
**That** teaches McKinsey-style structured communication  
**Unlike** public speaking courses, design tools, or AI template generators  
**We** focus on the substance, structure, and argument quality of sit-down business presentations.

## Category

**Primary:** Professional skills training (presentations) → evolving to AI-powered presentation creation  
**Adjacent:** Business communication, consulting skills, executive presence  
**NOT in:** Public speaking, graphic design, general productivity tools

## Market Opportunity

### Why Now
1. **AI is democratizing creation, but not quality** — Anyone can generate slides with AI. Few can generate *good* slides. The thinking gap is widening.
2. **Remote/hybrid work increased presentation frequency** — More decisions happen via deck, fewer via in-person conversation. Stakes are higher.
3. **Consulting methodology has always been gated** — Only people who worked at McKinsey/BCG/Bain learned this. We're making it accessible.
4. **Existing tools miss the point** — Canva, Gamma, Tome optimize for speed and design. Nobody optimizes for argument quality.

### Market Gaps We Fill
| Gap | Who Has It | Our Solution |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| "Tips don't work for boardroom decks" | Solo consultants, corporate professionals | Consulting methodology training |
| "My team's deliverables are inconsistent" | Boutique consultancies | Standardized methodology + training |
| "AI decks look generic and unfocused" | Anyone using AI for presentations | Methodology-informed AI generation |
| "I wasn't trained for executive presentations" | Corporate mid-career professionals | Structured learning path |

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
| Competitor | Their Focus | Our Differentiation | Their Strength |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Toastmasters** | Public speaking practice | We're about structure, not stage presence | Strong community, brand recognition |
| **Duarte** | Design-forward presentations | We're methodology-first, design second | Beautiful visual content, strong brand |
| **Beautiful.ai** | AI design tools | We teach thinking, not just formatting | Slick product, ease of use |
| **Canva** | Easy design for everyone | We're not a tool, we're methodology + tools | Massive market reach, freemium model |
| **Gamma** | AI-powered presentation creation | We embed consulting methodology, not just templates | First-mover in AI presentations |
| **Tome** | AI storytelling for presentations | We focus on business rigor, not storytelling | Strong brand, VC-backed |
| **Generic "presentation tips"** | Surface-level advice | We go deep on consulting methodology | SEO volume, easy consumption |

### Indirect Competitors
- **Books** (Minto, Tufte, Duarte) — Great theory, but no application support
- **YouTube tutorials** — Free, but shallow and delivery-focused
- **Corporate L&D programs** — Expensive, inconsistent quality
- **MBA communication courses** — Academic, limited practical application
- **Freelance presentation designers** — They do it FOR you, we teach you to do it YOURSELF

### Competitive Moats
1. **Methodology depth** — Most competitors don't have a coherent framework. We have 5S, SCQ, MECE.
2. **Institutional validation** — Seneca College, US DoE. Hard to replicate.
3. **Practitioner credibility** — Mike's background is real and relevant.
4. **Content library** — Years of blog content teaching the methodology (SEO value).
5. **AI + methodology combination** — Nobody else is combining consulting methodology with AI creation tools.

## Key Differentiators

*(Detailed in `company/differentiators.md`)*

### 1. Sit-Down Focus
We teach boardroom presentations, not keynotes. This is a fundamentally different skill.

### 2. Consulting Methodology
Our approach comes from the consulting world — McKinsey, BCG, Bain — not the speaking circuit.

### 3. Structure Over Style
We spend more time on argument structure than slide design. Pretty slides don't save bad thinking.

### 4. Practical Frameworks
Everything we teach can be applied immediately. No theory without application.

### 5. AI + Methodology (Emerging)
Our AI tools don't just generate slides — they apply the same principles DDM teaches. Methodology-informed creation.

## Taglines & Hooks

**Primary Tagline:** "Slay your presentation audiences"  
**Website Headline:** "High-Stakes Presentation Training"

**Alternate Hooks:**
- "McKinsey-style presentation training for professionals"
- "Business presentations that actually land"
- "The methodology behind world-class decks"
- "Stop presenting. Start convincing."
- "The presentation skills your MBA didn't teach"
- "Structure beats style. Every time."

## Positioning by Audience

### For Solo Consultants
"Deliverables that compete with Big 4 quality — at solo prices"

### For Corporate Professionals  
"The presentation skills that get you promoted"

### For Boutique Consultancies
"Consistent, executive-ready deliverables across your entire team"

### For Entrepreneurs
"Pitch decks that get meetings — and close deals"

## What We Stand Against

These are the contrarian positions that define us. Use them in content for differentiation and engagement:

- **TED-talk worship** — Boardrooms aren't stages. The skills that make you a great keynote speaker will get you fired in a strategy review.
- **Design-first thinking** — Pretty doesn't mean persuasive. A beautifully designed deck with a bad argument still loses.
- **Generic tips** — "Make eye contact" doesn't help you structure an argument. "Use fewer words" doesn't tell you WHICH words.
- **Presentation theater** — Business is not performance art. Your CFO doesn't want to be inspired. They want to be convinced.
- **AI magic thinking** — "Just let AI do it" produces fast garbage. Methodology + AI produces fast *quality*.

## The One-Liner Test

If someone asks "What does SlideHeroes do?":

**Short:** "We teach professionals how to create McKinsey-quality business presentations."

**Medium:** "We provide presentation methodology training for professionals who present to executives and decision-makers — the McKinsey-style, boardroom-first approach that most presentation advice completely ignores."

**Long:** "Most presentation advice is actually public speaking advice — how to stand on a stage and inspire. That's useless in a boardroom. SlideHeroes teaches the methodology that top consulting firms use to create compelling, structured, evidence-backed presentations. We're also building AI tools that embed this methodology into the creation process."

## Summary

SlideHeroes' current flagship is **Decks for Decision Makers (DDM)** — an online video course teaching McKinsey-style business presentation skills. An AI-powered SaaS platform is in development.

---

## Flagship Product: Decks for Decision Makers (DDM)

### What It Is
An online video course that teaches professionals how to create compelling sit-down business presentations using consulting methodology.

### Format
- 20 comprehensive video lessons
- 4+ hours of structured video training
- 20 detailed unit outlines with slides
- Free PowerPoint template (1,000+ professionally designed slides)
- Certification (shareable on LinkedIn)
- Instant access, available 24/7
- 30-day money-back guarantee

### The 5S Framework

The course teaches the **5S Framework** — a comprehensive methodology covering every dimension of presentation excellence:

| Element | Description | Key Lesson |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Structure** | The backbone of clear communication — organizing your argument | "Answer a question, don't present a topic" |
| **Story** | The power of narrative to engage and persuade | Use SCQ (Situation, Complication, Question) for introductions |
| **Substance** | Evidence, data, and facts that demonstrate your points | "Demonstrate, don't simply assert" |
| **Style** | Visual design that enhances rather than distracts | "Headlines should be assertions, not labels" |
| **Self-Confidence** | Presence and delivery when presenting | "If your meeting is important enough for a presentation, it's important enough for a GREAT one" |

### Key Concepts Taught

1. **"Answer a question, don't present a topic"** — Rather than presenting about "Customer Relationship Management Software," answer the question "Our CRM software is old — does it need to be replaced?"

2. **"Demonstrate, don't assert"** — Use data, facts, and compelling logic. The "because I say so" argument doesn't work in boardrooms.

3. **Barbara Minto's SCQ Framework** — Situation, Complication, Question for structuring introductions that grip the audience immediately.

4. **MECE Principle** — Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. Limit lists to no more than 5 items. If more, bucket them one level of abstraction higher.

5. **Headlines as assertions** — Not "Q3 Revenue" but "Q3 Revenue exceeded forecast by 12%." Labels are lazy. Assertions show you've done the thinking.

6. **Data visualization discipline** — Match chart type to data relationship. Don't use pie charts. Ensure the data visually proves the headline's claim.

7. **"McKinsey-style"** — Shorthand for structured, evidence-based, executive-ready presentations.

### Pricing

*(Current pricing tiers TBD by Mike)*

### Differentiator

> Most presentation advice focuses on PUBLIC SPEAKING (TED talks, keynotes, stage performances). SlideHeroes focuses on SIT-DOWN BUSINESS PRESENTATIONS — the McKinsey-style decks you present around a boardroom table. These require a fundamentally different approach.

---

## Team Training

Designed for boutique consultancies and corporate teams that need consistent deliverable quality:

- **Online learning model** takes 40-50% less employee time to learn concepts (vs. traditional workshops)
- **Proven methodology** ensures consistency across team — partner decks and associate decks match
- **Optional small group, live coaching** to receive feedback on real-world work
- **Scalable** — train new hires without partner time drain

**Positioning vs. alternatives:**
| Us | Big 4 Training | In-House |
|----|----------------|----------|
| ~$X per seat | $50K+ per workshop | Partner's time (most expensive resource) |
| Self-paced, always available | One-off event | Inconsistent, key-person dependent |
| Proven methodology | Varies by facilitator | Often tribal knowledge |

---

## Free Resources (Lead Generation)

These serve both as value-first marketing and as credibility builders:

- **Presentation Accelerator Kit** — Comprehensive collection of all resources we've ever made. Primary lead magnet.
- **Advanced Guide to Business Presentations** — eBook covering core methodology
- **PowerPoint Template** — 1,000+ professionally designed slides. High perceived value.
- **Blog articles** — Deep-dive content on specific presentation techniques. SEO-driven. Foundation of our methodology (give away the *what*, course teaches the *how*).
- **Presentation reviews** — Detailed teardowns of real consultancy decks (BCG, etc.) published on the blog. Demonstrates expertise.

**Content strategy:** Our free content is better than most competitors' paid content. This is intentional. Generosity builds trust and authority.

---

## AI-Powered SaaS Platform (In Development)

*(See `company/roadmap.md` for full details)*

The next evolution of SlideHeroes: an AI platform that embeds our methodology into the presentation creation process.

**Key difference from other AI tools:** Most AI presentation tools optimize for speed and visual polish. Ours will optimize for *argument quality* — structure, logic, evidence. The methodology DDM teaches, applied by AI.

---

## Product Landscape

| Product | Status | Revenue Model | Audience |
|---------|--------|---------------|----------|
| DDM Course | Live ✅ | One-time purchase | Individuals |
| Team Training | Live ✅ | Per-seat licensing | Consultancies, teams |
| Free Resources | Live ✅ | Lead gen (free) | All |
| AI SaaS Platform | In development 🔧 | Subscription (planned) | Individuals + teams |

---

## Anti-Patterns (What We DON'T Offer)

- One-on-one speech coaching (not our format)
- Design services — we teach, not do
- Public speaking anxiety therapy (not our domain)
- Keynote/TED talk preparation (different skill set entirely)
- "Make it pretty" template-only solutions (design without methodology)

---

## For Content Agents

When referencing products:
- **DDM** can be used after first introducing "Decks for Decision Makers"
- Always mention the **5S Framework** when describing the course
- Reference **free resources** generously — don't gatekeep
- The AI SaaS can be teased ("we're building tools") but don't over-promise features
- **Seneca College** and **US DoE** are the strongest proof points for course quality
