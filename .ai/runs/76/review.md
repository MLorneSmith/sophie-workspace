## FAIL

### Critical Issues:

**1. URL Verifiability Problems:**
- Multiple broken or questionable URLs
- alexanderjarvis.com is a third-party blog, not official McKinsey source (used 3 times)
- #6: "Available via HHS.gov" - no actual URL provided
- #13: polytechnic.purdue.edu URL has a typo ("NcKinsey")

**2. Insufficient Variety Across Firms:**
- 12 McKinsey vs 3 BCG — heavily skewed
- No examples from Bain, other consultancies, or corporate strategy decks

**3. Generic Cross-Analysis Claims:**
- Claims techniques like "McKinsey 7S, BCG Matrix" but none of the 15 presentations explicitly demonstrate these
- Techniques list appears to be generic consulting knowledge rather than specific observations

**4. "SlideHeroes Lessons" Missing:**
- Only 6 of 15 presentations have explicit SlideHeroes Lessons
- 9 presentations lack this critical output

### What Worked:
- Star ratings and "What makes it great" sections
- Industry variety is reasonable
- Four presentation styles are reasonably categorized
- No obvious factual errors beyond typo

**Primary failure:** Research does not deliver verifiable, accessible source material. Several presentations cannot be verified from URLs provided.
