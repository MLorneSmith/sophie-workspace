# How to Structure a Boardroom Presentation (That Executives Actually Read)

You walk into the boardroom. Seven executives around the table. The CFO is checking email. The CEO has their notebook open. You have 40 minutes to make your case.

Five slides in, you lose them.

Not because your thinking is weak. Not because your data is wrong. Because your boardroom presentation structure failed.

I've reviewed thousands of decks over two decades in consulting and corporate strategy. The same mistake shows up every time: smart consultants bury their argument under piles of information, then wonder why executives stopped listening.

Here's the truth: executives don't read presentations. They scan them. If they can't follow your logic in three seconds per slide, they're gone.

## The Problem: Most Presentations Are Topics, Not Arguments

Think about the last presentation you created. What was the deck titled?

"Q3 Revenue Update"
"Customer Retention Analysis"
"Marketing Strategy 2025"

These aren't presentations. They're topics.

A presentation should answer a specific question. "Should we expand into the European market?" "What's driving our customer churn?" "How do we accelerate growth next quarter?"

The difference matters because structure follows purpose. When you present a topic, you organize information. When you answer a question, you build an argument.

Executives don't want information. They can get that from a spreadsheet. They want your thinking. They want to know what you recommend and why.

## The Insight: Boardroom Presentations Are Not Speeches

Most presentation advice is actually public speaking advice. Make eye contact. Use hand gestures. Tell a story. Open with a joke.

This will get you fired in a boardroom.

Sit-down presentations around a table are fundamentally different from standing on a stage. In a keynote, the speaker controls the flow. In a boardroom, the audience does. They interrupt. They challenge. They jump ahead.

Your structure is your defense system. When an executive asks, "But what about X?" you need to know exactly where that fits in your argument. When they say, "Skip to the recommendation," you need to be able to land the plane.

The pyramid principle is that defense system.

## The Framework: SCQ and the Pyramid Structure

[Barbara Minto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minto_Pyramid_Principle) developed the pyramid principle during her 17 years at McKinsey. It's now the standard for structured consulting communication. Here's how it works.

### Start with SCQ

Every boardroom presentation should open with SCQ:

**S = Situation:** Where are we now? Establish the shared context that everyone in the room agrees on. This gets them nodding before you ask them to think.

*Example: "Our customer acquisition cost has risen 23% over the past six months, while lifetime value has remained flat."*

**C = Complication:** What's changed? What's the problem? The complication creates tension — the reason you're having this conversation.

*Example: "At current CAC levels, we'll exhaust our marketing budget by Q3 without improving conversion."*

**Q = Question:** What should we do? This is the question your presentation will answer.

*Example: "How do we reduce customer acquisition cost while maintaining growth targets?"*

The SCQ does three things: it establishes relevance, creates urgency, and sets expectations. Everyone in the room now knows why they're there and what you're solving for.

### Build a Single Pyramid

Your entire presentation should be one pyramid. The answer to your question sits at the top. Each supporting argument forms the next level. The evidence sits at the base.

The pyramid has one rule: every point must answer the question "so what?" for the point above it.

If your top-level answer is "We should reduce CAC by 20% through improved ad targeting," your second-level points might be:

1. Current targeting is inefficient
2. New targeting technology is available
3. Competitors using similar tech have reduced costs

Each of these must support the top-level claim. The third level — the evidence — supports the second level.

### Apply MECE

MECE stands for Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. It's the consulting secret sauce for structuring arguments.

**Mutually Exclusive:** Points don't overlap. If you say "reduce costs through better targeting" and "reduce costs through creative optimization," you might be double-counting the same ad spend.

**Collectively Exhaustive:** Together, your points cover the whole problem. If you present three options for growth but miss the fourth that's actually viable, your analysis looks incomplete.

When I see consultants fail MECE, it's usually because they started writing before they finished thinking. They dumped their brain onto slides instead of structuring the argument first.

### Limit Lists to Five Items

Here's a hard rule: never present more than five items in a list. Never.

Your brain can process about seven chunks of information. Five is safe. Six is pushing it. Seven is chaos.

If you have more than five points, bucket them. Create a level of abstraction higher. "Reduce CAC" might become "Improve marketing efficiency." Under that heading, you can list targeting, creative, and channel optimization — but the slide structure stays clean.

### Headlines Are Assertions, Not Labels

Every slide needs a headline. Not a title. A headline.

"Q3 Revenue" is a label. It tells me what's on the page. It forces me to do the work of figuring out what it means.

"Q3 Revenue exceeded forecast by 12%, driven by unexpected enterprise sales" is an assertion. It tells me the takeaway. I can read the headline and get your point without looking at the chart.

This is the three-second rule. In three seconds, an executive should understand your slide. If they need to hunt for the point, they've already tuned out.

## Application: Structure in Practice

Let me show you how this plays out with a real scenario.

### The Wrong Way

A solo consultant I know — let's call him James — was pitching a retail strategy project. His deck opened with:

"Retail Strategy Proposal"

Next slide: market analysis. Then competitor analysis. Then customer demographics. Then technology trends. Then... finally, 32 slides later... his recommendations.

The client's CEO stopped him on slide 8. "James, what are you actually proposing we do?"

James hadn't answered the question yet. He was still presenting the topic.

### The Right Way

Here's how James should have structured that deck:

**Slide 1 (SCQ):**
*Situation:* The retail client operates 120 stores with declining same-store sales.
*Complication:* New e-commerce competitors are capturing 40% of the market while store traffic drops 15% annually.
*Question:* How should the client restructure its retail strategy to compete effectively?

**Slide 2 (Top-Level Answer):**
"The client should restructure around three priorities: close underperforming stores, invest in omnichannel capabilities, and launch a premium loyalty program."

That's it. One slide. The CEO now knows where James is going.

**Slide 3 (Supporting Point 1):**
"Closing 18 underperforming stores will save $12M annually while losing only 5% of revenue."

**Slide 4 (Supporting Point 2):**
"Omnichannel investment will capture $8M in additional revenue within 18 months."

**Slide 5 (Supporting Point 3):**
"A premium loyalty program will increase customer lifetime value by 22% for the top 20% of customers."

Then evidence for each point. Then financial projections. Then implementation timeline.

The executive can follow the logic. They can jump ahead to financials if they want. They know where James is going at all times.

Notice the difference? In the wrong version, you're taking the board on a journey and hoping they reach the right destination. In the right version, you start at the destination and show them how you got there.

Executives prefer the latter. They've seen the journey before. They want the conclusion first.

## Common Structural Mistakes

I see these mistakes constantly. Avoid them.

### The Mystery Novel Deck

You present background, then analysis, then more analysis, then... ta-da! Your recommendation on the final slide.

This is not storytelling. It's withholding information. Executives aren't reading for entertainment. They're there for decisions. Give them the answer upfront.

### The Laundry List

You have 10 supporting points and you list them all. The pyramid becomes a blob.

Group them. If you have 10 points, you probably have 3-4 categories. Use the categories as your second level. List the 10 points as evidence.

### The Orphan Slide

A slide that doesn't connect to the main argument. It's there because you did the analysis and it's interesting data, but it doesn't answer the question.

Cut it. Or move it to an appendix. Every slide must pull its weight. If it doesn't advance your argument, delete it.

### The Assumption Trap

You assume the audience sees what you see. "This chart shows we're gaining market share." But the chart actually shows revenue growth — and revenue could grow from price increases while market share shrinks.

Make your assertions explicit. Don't let the data do the talking. You do the talking. The data proves you're right.

### The Missing So What

You present evidence without connecting it to your argument. "Our NPS score is 42." So what? Is that good? Bad? What does it mean for your recommendation?

Every piece of evidence must connect to an argument, and every argument must connect to your main answer. The so what chain cannot have gaps.

## How to Structure Your Next Deck

Here's your step-by-step process:

1. **Define the question.** Not the topic. The question. What specific problem are you answering? Write it down.

2. **Draft your answer.** One sentence. If you can't state your recommendation in one sentence, you don't have a recommendation.

3. **Identify your supporting arguments.** What are the 3-5 reasons your answer is correct? Check that they're MECE.

4. **Gather evidence.** Data, facts, examples that prove each supporting argument.

5. **Build your SCQ.** Situation (context everyone agrees on), Complication (why we're here), Question (what you're answering).

6. **Outline your deck:**
   - Slide 1: SCQ
   - Slide 2: Main answer
   - Slides 3-7: Supporting arguments
   - Slides 8-20: Evidence for each argument
   - Slides 21-25: Implications, risks, next steps

7. **Write headlines.** For every slide, write a headline that's an assertion. Not a label.

8. **Review the pyramid.** Does every point answer "so what?" for the point above it? If not, fix the structure.

9. **Cut ruthlessly.** Delete any slide that doesn't advance the main argument. Move non-essential analysis to appendices.

10. **Present.** Start with the answer. Then show your work.

## The Result: Executives Who Actually Read Your Deck

When you structure your boardroom presentation this way, something shifts.

Executives stop checking email. They stop asking "where are we going?" because they know. They engage with your argument instead of struggling to find it.

I've seen this happen hundreds of times. A consultant walks in with a tightly structured pyramid. The CEO leans forward. The CFO looks at the data and nods. The conversation moves from "what are you saying?" to "how do we make this happen?"

That's the difference between a presentation that gets ignored and a presentation that drives decisions.

Your next deck can be one of them.
