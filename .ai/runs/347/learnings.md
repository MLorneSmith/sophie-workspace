## Iteration 2 Review Notes (2026-02-10T20:37:23+00:00)

# Review: How to Structure a Boardroom Presentation (That Executives Actually Read)

## Overall Assessment

This is a strong, comprehensive post that nails the SlideHeroes voice and delivers genuine value. It reads like something Mike would write — authoritative, practical, opinionated, and generous with methodology.

## Brand Voice: ✅ Strong

- Contrarian: ✅ Directly attacks TED-talk advice, calls out "information vomit," says boardroom ≠ stage
- Expert: ✅ Speaks with earned authority ("I've reviewed thousands of decks"), no hedging
- Generous: ✅ Gives away the full SCQ + Pyramid framework — not a teaser
- Direct: ✅ Short paragraphs, declarative sentences, "Just don't" energy
- Practical: ✅ Step-by-step process at the end, before/after examples throughout

## Persona Targeting: ✅ Strong

- Solo consultant persona hit directly (James scenario, pitch deck context, competing with Big 4)
- Pain points addressed: "I know my content but can't structure it," "My presentations don't land," buried recommendations
- Specific deliverables mentioned: pitch decks, strategy reviews, board presentations
- Acknowledges expertise while identifying the gap — doesn't talk down

## Blog Guidelines Compliance

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Word count ≥ 1,000 | ✅ ~2,400 words |
| H1 title with keyword | ✅ "boardroom presentation" in title |
| Opening hook (first 100 words) | ✅ Vivid boardroom scene |
| Clear thesis | ✅ Structure is the problem, pyramid is the solution |
| Minimum 3 H2 sections | ✅ 7 H2 sections |
| CTA in conclusion | ✅ DDM course CTA |
| Short paragraphs (≤3 sentences) | ✅ Consistently maintained |
| Internal links ≥ 2 | ❌ **No internal links** |
| External link ≥ 1 | ❌ **No external links** (Barbara Minto reference could link out) |
| Meta description | ❌ **Not provided** |
| Featured image alt text | ❌ **Not provided** |

## Vocabulary Check: ✅ Clean

- No banned terms ("tips," "hacks," "tricks," "game-changer," "inspire," "unpack")
- Uses correct terminology: "sit-down presentations," "McKinsey-style," "assertions not labels," "structure," "argument"
- No generic AI filler ("In today's fast-paced world," "It's important to note that," etc.)

## Content Quality: ✅ Excellent

- The James scenario is well-crafted and persona-specific
- Before/after structure examples are concrete and immediately usable
- The "Common Structural Mistakes" section is classic SlideHeroes — opinionated, specific, actionable
- The 10-step process at the end is a genuine takeaway readers can apply tomorrow
- SCQ explanation is thorough without being academic

## Minor Notes

- The "five items" rule section says "Your brain can process about seven chunks of information" — this references Miller's Law, which has been contested in recent research. Not wrong, but could attract pedantic pushback. Minor.
- The closing CTA is solid but slightly long. Could be tightened.

## Issues Requiring Fix

1. **Missing internal links (required: ≥2).** Add at least two links to other SlideHeroes content (e.g., link to a post about data visualization when charts are mentioned, link to DDM course page).
2. **Missing external link (required: ≥1).** Link to Barbara Minto's work or Edward Tufte when referencing the pyramid principle.
3. **Missing meta description.** Provide a 120-160 character meta description with the primary keyword.
4. **Missing featured image alt text.** Provide alt text for the featured image.

These are SEO requirements per the blog guidelines and must be present.

VERDICT: FAIL

**Actionable fixes for next iteration:**
1. Add ≥2 internal links to other SlideHeroes pages/posts (e.g., DDM course page, related blog posts on headlines or data visualization)
2. Add ≥1 external link (e.g., link to Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle book or Wikipedia page when first mentioned)
3. Add a meta description, e.g.: `"Learn the SCQ and pyramid structure that consulting firms use to build boardroom presentations executives actually read and act on."`
4. Add featured image suggestion with alt text
