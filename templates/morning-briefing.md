# Morning Briefing Template
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Run: ~/clawd/scripts/morning-briefing-data.sh > /tmp/briefing-data.json
# 2. Read this template
# 3. Fill every {{PLACEHOLDER}} with data from the JSON
# 4. For [COMPOSE] sections, write original content based on the data
# 5. Run validation: ~/clawd/scripts/validate-briefing.sh /tmp/briefing-draft.md
# 6. Fix any validation errors, then send
#
# RULES:
# - NEVER use localhost URLs — they don't work from Discord
# - NEVER skip a section — if no data, say "None" or "No items"
# - ALWAYS include calendar even if empty
# - Use Discord-friendly formatting (no markdown tables)
