# Content Capture Process

*How to capture best practices from content you consume on mobile*

---

## Overview

When you find valuable content on your phone, share it to the **#capture** Discord channel. Sophie will:
1. Fetch the content (article text, video transcript, Reddit thread)
2. Extract actionable best practices using LLM
3. Add them to the Notion Best Practices database

---

## Supported Sources

| Source | What Gets Captured |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Substack** | Full article text |
| **YouTube** | Video transcript |
| **Reddit** | Post + top comments |

---

## How to Capture

### From Any App (iOS/Android)

1. Find content worth capturing
2. Tap **Share** button
3. Select **Discord**
4. Choose **#capture** channel
5. Send

That's it. Sophie handles the rest.

### Adding Context (Optional)

If you want to highlight a specific section or provide context:

```
https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123
Focus on the section about pricing tiers — around 12 minutes in
```

```
https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/...
The top comment has a great framework for cold outreach
```

## What Sophie Extracts

For each piece of content, Sophie identifies:

- **Best Practices** (3-7 per piece)
  - Specific, actionable recommendations
  - Not generic ("work hard") but tactical ("send follow-ups within 24h")
  
- **For each practice:**
  - Practice statement (1-2 sentences)
  - Domain (Sales, Product, Marketing, etc.)
  - Context (when to apply)
  - Implementation notes (how to do it)

---

## Where Practices Go

Extracted practices are stored in:
- **Notion → Best Practices database**
- **Sophie's memory** (for applying to active work)

You can:
- Search Notion by domain/tag
- Ask Sophie: "What do I know about pricing?"
- Review in Weekly Review

---

## Processing Time

- **Articles:** ~30 seconds
- **YouTube videos:** 1-2 minutes (transcript fetch)
- **Reddit threads:** ~30 seconds

Sophie will reply in #capture when extraction is complete.

## Examples

### Substack Article
```
https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production
```
→ Extracts practices about deployment, feature flags, rollout strategies

### YouTube Video
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C27RVio2rOs
This is about positioning
```
→ Extracts practices about market positioning, competitive differentiation

### Reddit Thread
```
https://reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/xyz/how_we_got_our_first_100_customers
The founder's comment about cold email is gold
```
→ Extracts practices about customer acquisition, cold outreach

---

## Alternative Capture Methods

### Readwise (For Heavy Article Readers)
If you read a lot of articles, consider Readwise Reader ($8/mo):
- Share extension for articles
- Highlight key passages
- Auto-syncs to Notion
- Better for deep reading vs. quick capture

### Batch Capture
If you prefer to save content throughout the week:
1. Save in-app (YouTube Save, Reddit Save, etc.)
2. Weekly: Share saved items to #capture
3. Sophie processes in batch

---

## Domains/Categories

Practices are tagged by domain:

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Sales** | Pricing, outreach, negotiation, closing |
| **Product** | Features, UX, roadmap, prioritization |
| **Marketing** | Positioning, content, messaging, channels |
| **Operations** | Processes, efficiency, automation |
| **Leadership** | Management, hiring, culture, decisions |
| **Technical** | Architecture, coding, DevOps, AI/ML |
| **Personal** | Productivity, learning, health |

---

## Tips

1. **Capture generously** — Better to have too many practices than miss good ones
2. **Add context** — "Focus on X" helps extraction quality
3. **Don't overthink** — Just share the link, refine later
4. **Review weekly** — Check new practices in Notion, mark as "Applied" when you use them
