# Quarterly Strategic Review — Agenda Template

## 1. Scorecard Check (15 min)
- Review KR targets vs actuals for each active objective
- Which KRs hit? Which missed? Why?
- Any vanity metrics we should drop?

## 2. Objective Priority Reset (15 min)
- Are the current top 3 still the right top 3?
- Have any deferred objectives become urgent? (e.g., audience/acquisition ready to activate?)
- Should any active objectives be paused or deprioritized?
- New objectives to add?

## 3. Initiative Health Check (15 min)
- For each active objective: which initiatives shipped, stalled, or pivoted?
- Any initiatives to merge, split, or retire?
- New initiatives needed based on what we learned?
- Are initiative descriptions still accurate?

## 4. Resource & Capacity Reality Check (10 min)
- Team size / bandwidth — has it changed?
- Budget / tool spend — still aligned?
- Sophie's capabilities — what's new, what's blocked?
- Biggest bottleneck last quarter?

## 5. Competitive & Market Pulse (10 min)
- Any competitive moves that change our priorities?
- Customer feedback themes?
- Market/industry shifts worth responding to?

## 6. Next Quarter Priorities (15 min)
- Set the new priority order (Obj 1 > X > Y)
- Set KR targets for next quarter
- Identify the 3-5 "must ship" initiatives
- Update MEMORY.md and state/current.md with new priorities

## 7. Housekeeping (10 min)
