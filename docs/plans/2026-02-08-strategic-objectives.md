## Overview

**Framing:** Objectives are outcome-focused and aspirational. Key Results underneath are measurable and time-bound. Per quarter, activate 2-3 objectives as primary focus — don't chase all 7 simultaneously.

### 5. 💎 Delight & Retain Customers

Keep paying customers engaged, successful, and growing with SlideHeroes.

**Scope:** Everything post-sale — onboarding experience, engagement and usage growth, churn reduction, support, community building, feedback collection, expansion revenue (upsells within active customers), and NPS. The goal is LTV:CAC > 3x.

**Key Results:**
- KR: Monthly churn < [X]%
- KR: NPS of [Y]+ across active customer base
- KR: [Z]% of active users engage weekly

### 6. 🤖 Build the AI & Content Engine

## Quarterly Focus Guide

For a bootstrapped 1-2 person team, focus on 2-3 objectives per quarter. Example phasing:

| Quarter | Primary Focus | Why |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Q1 2026** | #1 Product + #6 AI Engine + #7 Business OS | Build the foundation — product, systems, knowledge |
| **Q2 2026** | #1 Product + #2 Audience + #3 Existing Customers | Ship beta, start marketing, activate existing base |
| **Q3 2026** | #4 New Customers + #5 Retain + #2 Audience | Grow beyond existing base, keep what you've got |
| **Q4 2026** | #4 New Customers + #5 Retain + #1 Product | Scale acquisition, optimize retention, iterate product |

*Phasing is illustrative — adjust based on actual progress and market signals.*

## How This Maps to Mission Control

When the 3-level hierarchy is implemented (Sophie Loop Phase 3):

| Level | Entity | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Strategic Objective** | These 7 objectives | "Build a Product Customers Love" |
| **Initiative** | A coherent body of work | "Ship AI template generation MVP" |
| **Task** | Single unit of work | "Implement template preview component" |

Current MC boards will be replaced by or mapped to these objectives.
