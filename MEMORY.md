## CodeRabbit — Code Review Integration (Feb 24 2026)

**Two-stage code review process:**

1. **Pre-commit CLI:** `coderabbit --prompt-only --base upstream/dev` — catches issues before PR
2. **Post-PR webhook:** CodeRabbit reviews PR → webhook fires → Sophie iterates → Mike reviews clean PR

**Setup:**
- **Account:** Sophie's GitHub (`SophieLegerPA`) — $24/month Pro plan
- **CLI:** `coderabbit` v0.3.6 installed at `~/.local/bin/coderabbit`
- **Webhook:** GitHub → Tailscale funnel → `github-webhook-proxy` (port 8790) → OpenClaw hook
- **Config:** `.coderabbit.yaml` in repo root with stack-specific rules

**Workflow:**
```
Sophie codes → coderabbit --prompt-only → fix issues → commit → push →
CodeRabbit reviews PR → webhook → Sophie iterates → Mike reviews clean PR
```

**SOP:** `~/clawd/docs/sops/coderabbit-workflow.md`

## 🤖 Agent Fleet (Feb 23 2026)

**5-agent architecture** with isolated workspaces and curated skills per agent:

| Agent | Model | Workspace | Skills | Cron Jobs | Role |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|-----------|------|
| 🦁 **Sophie** | Opus 4.6 | `~/clawd/skills/` (33) | All business, content, research, perplexity-research | 6 | Orchestration, conversation, planning |
| 🧑‍💻 **Coder** | GPT-5.3 Codex (ccproxy) | `~/coder-agent/skills/` (10) | coding-agent, context7, systematic-debugging, github, gh-issues, tailwind-*, frontend-design, vercel-react, supabase-postgres | 2 (nightly backlog + initiatives) | Implementation, PRs, bug fixes |
| 🔍 **Research** | GLM-5 | `~/research-agent/skills/` (7) | perplexity-research, context7, seo-audit, stealth-browser, blog-post-optimizer, find-skills, web-design-guidelines | 3 (feed scoring, competitive intel, content extraction) | Competitive intel, market research, content extraction |
| 🛠️ **DevOps** | GLM-5 | `~/devops-agent/skills/` (2) | healthcheck, github | 5 (monitoring, backups, updates) | Infrastructure, health checks |
| 🔄 **Pipeline** | GLM-5 | `~/data-pipeline-agent/skills/` (0) | None | 1 (ETL + dbt) | Data syncs & transforms |

**Agent YAML configs:** `~/clawd/.ai/agents/` (coder.yaml, researcher.yaml, devops.yaml, etc.)

**Key design decisions:**
- Skills are **symlinked** from source to each agent's workspace (updates propagate automatically)
- Bundled OpenClaw skills (53) are injected into every agent by OpenClaw itself — can't control that
- Sophie orchestrates and delegates to specialized agents; went from 18 → 6 cron jobs
- Codex for code, GLM for routine/bulk work, Opus for reasoning/planning

**Sophie = Orchestrator, not implementer.** Sophie's job is to route work to the right agent, not do it herself. If Sophie spends >5 min on a task without Mike interaction, it should have been delegated. See AGENTS.md for delegation rules.

## Council v2 - Multi-Agent Deliberation (Feb 7 2026)

Built multi-model council debates in Mission Control. Claude/GPT/GLM deliberate on topics.

**Key architecture insight:** Sub-agents cannot spawn sub-agents (Clawdbot design). Main session must orchestrate true multi-model debates directly.

**Trigger:** Mission Control UI → POST /api/council/debates with `run: true` → webhook → main session spawns 3 models

**Location:** `~/clawd/slideheroes-internal-tools/app/src/app/council/`

---

## Mission Control Reference Design (Feb 2026)

Mike shared reference screenshots from **Henry AI / yourhenry.ai** as the design to emulate for our Mission Control dashboard.

**Key elements:**
- Dark theme, polished second-brain aesthetic
- Top nav with tabs: Tasks, Projects, Memory, Captures, Docs, People
- Tasks view: Kanban board (Recurring → Backlog → In Progress → Review) + Activity feed
- Docs view: Left sidebar with search/filters, file list, markdown document viewer
- Task cards: title, description, linked resource, project badge, timestamp

**Reference files saved:**
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/reference-designs/mission-control-tasks-view.png`
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/reference-designs/mission-control-docs-view.png`
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/reference-designs/MISSION-CONTROL-SPEC.md`

Current Mission Control does NOT match this design — needs rebuild.

---

## Mission Control = Shared System (Feb 9 2026)

**Key pivot:** Mission Control is NOT just Sophie's work board. It's the integrated view of everything Mike and Sophie need to do collectively. The roadmap, objectives, initiatives, and tasks are shared.

- **MC Kanban** = shared strategic/operational tasks (Mike + Sophie)
- **Todoist** = mirrors MC structure for Mike's daily task management + personal lists
- **Assignee field** added to tasks: `mike`, `sophie`, `both`, or `null`
- **Sync cron** planned: MC ↔ Todoist two-way sync

Previously MC was "Sophie's board" and Todoist was "Mike's board" — that's no longer the case.

---

## Projects & Repos

- **2025slideheroes** - The main SlideHeroes product repo. DO NOT touch unless Mike explicitly asks.
- **slideheroes-internal-tools** - Sophie has full commit/merge authority. Contains Feed Monitor, Mission Control, and internal tooling.

---

## SOP: Working on 2025slideheroes (Feb 5 2026)

**Before starting ANY work on 2025slideheroes, sync with upstream:**

```bash
cd ~/2025slideheroes-sophie

# Fetch latest from upstream (main repo)
git fetch upstream

# Check out the branch you're working from (usually dev)
git checkout dev

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/dev

# Push to origin (Sophie's fork) to keep it current
git push origin dev
```

**For feature branches:**
```bash
# Create feature branch from latest upstream/dev
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b feature/my-feature upstream/dev

# ... do work, commit ...

# Push to fork
git push origin feature/my-feature

# Create PR: fork → main repo's dev branch
```

**Why this matters:** The main repo may have changes from Mike or other sources. Working on stale code leads to merge conflicts and wasted effort. Always start fresh.

---

## slideheroes-internal-tools CI/CD (Feb 2 2026)

**Pipeline:** Push → CI (GitHub Actions) → Webhook → Auto-deploy to EC2 → Discord notification

**Key components:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — lint, typecheck, test, build
- `/api/deploy` webhook endpoint — validates GitHub signature, triggers deploy.sh
- `deploy.sh` — pulls, builds, restarts service, sends Discord notification
- `dev-server.sh` — on-demand dev server on localhost:3002 for UI debugging

**Secrets/Config:**
- `DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local` — validates GitHub webhook
- `DISCORD_DEPLOY_WEBHOOK` in `.env.local` — notifications to #inbox-sophie
- GitHub webhook configured to send `workflow_run` events to `https://internal.slideheroes.com/api/deploy`
- Cloudflare Access bypass rule for `/api/deploy` path

**Service:** `internal-tools.service` (systemd) on port 3001, proxied via Caddy at `internal.slideheroes.com`

---

## Mission Control Docs Strategy (Feb 2 2026)

MC Docs = the **collaboration layer** between Mike and Sophie. Not personal knowledge (→ Notion), not operational state (→ Sophie workspace).

**4 Document Categories:**
1. **Project Contexts** — Briefs, specs, decision logs (tag: `project`)
2. **Sophie Deliverables** — Recommendations, research, proposals for Mike's review (tag: `deliverable`)
3. **Working Agreements** — How we collaborate, processes, standards (tag: `agreement`)
4. **Reference (Shared)** — APIs, accounts, setup guides we both need (tag: `reference`)

**The Test:** Before adding a doc, ask "Does Sophie need this to collaborate with Mike?"
- Yes → MC Docs
- No, Mike's knowledge → Notion
- No, Sophie's operational data → Sophie workspace (`memory/`, `state/`)

**Workflow:**
- Sophie writes to `~/clawd/deliverables/`
- Registers with MC Docs API
- Mike reviews in MC Docs UI
- Approved docs can graduate to Notion if needed

**Full spec:** `deliverables/mission-control-docs-recommendation.md`

## Best Practices Capture System (Feb 2 2026)

**#capture channel** (Discord id: `1468019433854210259`) — Mike shares links from mobile, Sophie extracts best practices.

**When a link appears in #capture:**
1. Identify source type (Substack article, YouTube video, Reddit thread)
2. Fetch content:
   - Substack/articles: use `web_fetch` for article text
   - YouTube: fetch transcript via API (youtube-transcript-api or supadata.ai)
   - Reddit: fetch post + top comments via `web_fetch`
3. Run extraction prompt to identify 3-7 actionable best practices
4. Each practice needs: statement, domain, context, implementation notes
5. Add to Notion Best Practices database (when API connected)
6. Reply in #capture confirming extraction complete

**Domains:** Sales, Product, Marketing, Operations, Leadership, Technical, Personal

**Docs:** `docs/capture-process.md`, `deliverables/best-practices-extraction-recommendation.md`

---

## Opus 4.6 Capabilities Research (Feb 7 2026)

Researched Opus 4.6 at Mike's request. Key new features:
- **1M token context window** (beta) — 5x increase, eliminates context rot
- **Adaptive thinking** — 4 effort levels (low/medium/high/max), replaces binary extended thinking
- **Compaction API** — server-side context summarization for infinite conversations
- **128K output tokens** — double previous 64K
- **Agent Teams** (research preview) — parallel agent coordination
- **Claude in PowerPoint** (research preview) — reads layouts/fonts/slide masters, generates full decks
- **ARC AGI 2: 68.8%** (nearly 2x Opus 4.5's 37.6%), BrowseComp 84%, Finance Agent 60.7%
- Same pricing as Opus 4.5

**Identified new workflow opportunities:**
1. Full codebase reviews (1M context)
2. PowerPoint prototype generation (directly relevant to SlideHeroes product)
3. Financial modeling for SlideHeroes
4. Multi-document batch research synthesis
5. Deeper Council debates with max effort reasoning
6. End-to-end spec → implementation with agent teams
7. Competitive analysis at scale

## CCProxy — ChatGPT Pro via OpenClaw (Feb 24 2026)

**Problem:** OpenClaw's built-in `openai-codex` provider routes through `chatgpt.com/backend-api`, but Cloudflare blocks server-side requests from EC2. The ChatGPT OAuth token lacks `model.request` scope for the standard `api.openai.com` endpoint — that's by design, it's meant for ChatGPT's backend API only.

**Solution:** `ccproxy-api` (v0.2.3) runs locally on port 8787, bridging the ChatGPT OAuth token to an OpenAI-compatible API. Registered as custom provider `openai-ccproxy` in OpenClaw.

**Architecture:** `OpenClaw → openai-ccproxy/gpt-5.2 → localhost:8787 → ccproxy → chatgpt.com/backend-api → GPT-5.2`

**Key components:**
- **ccproxy:** systemd service (`ccproxy.service`), config at `~/.config/ccproxy/config.toml`
- **Auth:** Uses `~/.codex/auth.json` (managed by `codex login`)
- **OpenClaw provider:** `openai-ccproxy` with `baseUrl: http://127.0.0.1:8787/codex/v1/`
- **Auth profile:** Dummy `api_key` profile (`openai-ccproxy:default`) — ccproxy doesn't need real auth from OpenClaw
- **Alias:** `codex` → `openai-ccproxy/gpt-5.2`
- **Cost:** $0 extra — uses Mike's ChatGPT Pro subscription

**What was updated:**
- Coder agent model: `openai-ccproxy/gpt-5.2`
- model-dispatch.json: `code` role → `openai-ccproxy/gpt-5.2`
- All 10 cron jobs that used `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex` → `openai-ccproxy/gpt-5.2`

**If it breaks:** Check `sudo systemctl status ccproxy`. If auth expired: `codex login` + `sudo systemctl restart ccproxy`.

**SOP:** `~/clawd/docs/sops/ccproxy-setup.md`

---

## Coding Sub-Agent Strategy (Feb 8 2026)

**Primary coding agent: Sophie Loop workflow via `~/clawd/.ai/loop-runner.py`**

**Standing decisions:**
- **No new paid tools** — avoid cost sprawl, keep server aligned with Mike's local dev
- **No environment divergence** — server dev environment must mirror Mike's local setup
- **Alpha Orchestrator is Mike-only** — reserved for his local Claude Code usage
- **Use existing subscriptions** — OAuth via ChatGPT/Claude subscriptions, not direct API keys
- **Codex for coding, Opus for everything else** — clear model separation

**Current workflow:**
- Sophie Loop (`~/clawd/.ai/loop-runner.py`) orchestrates autonomous work
- Agent profiles defined in `~/clawd/.ai/agents/*.yaml`
- Model selection via `~/clawd/config/model-dispatch.json` (source of truth)
- Coder agent uses GPT-5.3 Codex for implementation work (via ccproxy)

**Model dispatch roles:**
- `code` → `ccproxy/gpt-5.3-codex` (implementation, PRs, bug fixes — via ccproxy → ChatGPT Pro, coding-optimized)
- `research` → `zai/glm-5` (web search, bulk lookups, competitive analysis)
- `bulk` → `zai/glm-5` (batch processing, data extraction, drafts)
- `default` → `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` (conversation, planning, reasoning)

**Auth status:** Codex CLI configured. Mike has a Todoist task to switch to OAuth via ChatGPT subscription (`codex login --device-auth`).

---

## ZAI/GLM Endpoint — RESOLVED (Feb 8 2026)

**DO NOT FORGET THIS.** Mike's Z.AI subscription uses the **Coding Plan**, which requires a different API endpoint:

- **Regular API:** `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/`
- **Coding Plan (Mike's subscription):** `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4/`

**Config fix:** Added `models.providers.zai` in OpenClaw config (`openclaw.json`) with `baseUrl` set to the coding endpoint. Without this, GLM calls fail with billing errors because they hit the wrong endpoint.

**This was a recurring issue (3 times!)** — always check this if GLM stops working.

---

## GLM-5 > GPT-5.2 for Coding Sub-Agents (Feb 25 2026)

**Finding:** GPT-5.2 via ccproxy gets stuck in "thinking" loops without executing tools. GLM-5 executes cleanly.

**Observed behavior:**
- GPT-5.2: Repeated same git/find commands 10+ times without writing code
- GLM-5: Explored → understood types → created files → committed → pushed → created PR

**Recommendation:** Use `zai/glm-5` for coding sub-agents until ccproxy stabilizes. Keep GPT-5.2 for interactive/local use only.

**Task #485** (Agent Suggestions UI) was completed by GLM-5 after GPT-5.2 failed 3 times → PR #2185.

---

## Model Dispatch Architecture (Feb 9 2026)

**Deterministic role-based model selection** to prevent model drift.

**Config:** `~/clawd/config/model-dispatch.json` — single source of truth (canonical)
**Script:** `~/clawd/scripts/dispatch-model.sh <role>` — returns model ID

**Roles:**
- `code` → `openai-ccproxy/gpt-5.2` (implementation, PRs, bug fixes — via ccproxy → ChatGPT Pro)
- `research` → `zai/glm-4.7` (web search, bulk lookups, competitive analysis)
- `bulk` → `zai/glm-4.7` (batch processing, data extraction, drafts)
- `default` → `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` (conversation, planning, reasoning)

**Fallback chain:** ccproxy/GPT-5.2 → GLM → Opus

**ALWAYS set model explicitly when spawning sub-agents.** Never rely on defaults. Check the dispatch config.

**Note:** Model preferences are also documented in USER.md for human reference, but model-dispatch.json is the canonical source of truth.

---

## Morning Briefing — Cron Job is Source of Truth (Feb 9 2026)

The morning briefing is generated by cron job `2cd6c98b-85bd-4b7c-9459-fb408df8f889` (isolated session). The cron payload is the ONLY thing that matters — `ROUTINES.md` and `templates/morning-briefing.md` are reference docs but the cron job doesn't read them.

**To change the briefing:** Update the cron job payload via `cron update`. NOT by editing ROUTINES.md.

**Data script:** `~/clawd/scripts/morning-briefing-data.sh` → `/tmp/briefing-data.json` — collects all data including signed Cloudflare Worker feedback URLs, calendar from ALL 6 calendars, model usage, weather, etc.

**Calendar:** Queries 5 calendars (sophie@, Mike↔Sophie shared, michael@slideheroes, michael.lorne.smith@gmail, Family Birthdays) — not just `primary`.

---

## Key Platform/Tool Decisions (Updated Feb 9 2026)

- **CRM:** Attio (chosen, initial setup done)
- **Email platform:** Migrating from ActiveCampaign → Loops
- **YouTube transcripts:** Supadata API (key in ~/.clawdbot/.env as SUPADATA_API_KEY)
- **MC ↔ Todoist sync:** Rewritten to use Sync API with delta-based syncing, ID-only matching, soft-close deletions. State file: config/todoist-sync-state.json. MC is source of truth for new tasks.
- **Capture system:** v2 designed (11 intents, Discord + email input). Design: docs/plans/2026-02-09-capture-system-v2-design.md. Task #262.
- **AWS EC2:** c7i-flex.large in us-east-2. Base ~$2.65/day. RI purchase pending (saves 34%).

---

## Preferences & Notes

- Mike prefers friendly + professional tone
- Default model: Opus 4.6 (conversation, planning, research, complex reasoning)
- Coding sub-agents: Codex CLI / GPT-5.3-codex (implementation work)
- Coding fallback: GLM 4.7 if Codex unavailable
- GLM for bulk/slow tasks: batch processing, scheduled jobs, draft generation, research summaries
- Nightly builds: delegate to GPT agent → internal-tools repo → Sophie reviews/merges → Mike reviews in morning
