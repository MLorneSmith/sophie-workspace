# Current State — 2026-02-09

## 🎯 Strategic Priorities (Q1 2026)
1. **🚀 Obj 1 — Build a Product Customers Love**
2. **🤖 Obj 6 — Build the AI Systems**
3. **⚙️ Obj 7 — Build the Business Operating System**

When choosing proactive work: Obj 1 > 6 > 7. Objectives 2-5 deferred until post-product.

## Active Work
- All 7 objectives have initiatives defined (35 total)
- Sophie Loop: Phases 1-6 done, Phase 7 test run in progress (task #76 — builder done, reviewer running)
- GLM/ZAI fixed — env var was `GLM_API_KEY`, OpenClaw needs `ZAI_API_KEY`

## What's Next
1. Sophie Loop Phase 6: Orchestrator Wiring (MC task #86)
2. Fill in KR targets for Q1 objectives (#1, #6, #7) — needs Mike
3. Sophie Loop Phase 7: End-to-end test run

## Completed Tonight (Feb 8-9)
- Todoist cleanup: 18 dups closed, 3 done tasks closed, "Build App" merged into "App Build"

## Recent Completions (Feb 8-9)
- Created 35 initiatives across all 7 strategic objectives
- Sorted 49 Obj 7 tasks into 5 initiatives (zero orphans)
