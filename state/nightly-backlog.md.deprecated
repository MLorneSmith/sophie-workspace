# Nightly Backlog

*Tasks for Sophie to work on overnight while Mike sleeps.*

## Guidelines
- Only add tasks that can be done **autonomously** (no questions needed)
- Nothing destructive or external-facing
- Good candidates: code cleanup, documentation, research, organizing files

## Backlog

*(empty — add tasks as needed)*

---
*Format: `- [ ] Task description` — Sophie will check off when done*
