## Campaign Narrative Arc

**The Story We're Telling:**
We're on a journey. You bought into a vision (great presentations). We discovered something bigger (AI changes everything). Now we're building something that will transform how you create presentations—and we want you with us.

**Emotional Progression:**
1. **Reconnection** - "We remember you" → Warmth, recognition
2. **Agitation** - "Presentations are still hard" → Recognition of pain
3. **Vision** - "What if..." → Excitement, possibility
4. **Proof** - "Look what's possible" → Belief, desire
5. **Invitation** - "Join us" → Action, belonging

## Email 1: Re-introduction

**Purpose:** Warm reconnection, acknowledge their purchase, set up the pivot story

**Hook Type:** Personal Anecdote + Transparency
**Hook:**
"We've been quiet for a while. Not because we stopped caring—because we started building something bigger."

**Core Message:**
- Thank them for being an early customer
- Acknowledge we've been heads-down building
- Tease the pivot without revealing it yet

## Email 2: Problem/Pain

**Purpose:** Remind them of presentation struggles, agitate the pain

**Hook:**
"Here's the thing nobody tells you about business presentations: Most 'presentation tips' are actually speech tips. And they're getting you killed in the boardroom."

**Core Message:**
- Remind them: business presentations ≠ TED talks
- The problem: generic advice doesn't apply to their context
- The pain: hours spent, slides that don't land, executives who tune out
- The realization: "I taught you the principles, but the process is still broken"

**Key Techniques:**
- Contrarian positioning (challenge conventional wisdom)

## Email 3: Vision

**Purpose:** Reveal the AI-powered future, create excitement

**Hook Type:** Mystery + Cultural Reference
**Hook:**
"Imagine if McKinsey's smartest consultant and Pixar's best designer had a child... then gave that child superpowers. That's what we're building."

**Core Message:**
- The big reveal: we're going AI
- Why AI matters for presentations (not just "more features")

- The 5S Framework, but automated

**Key Techniques:**
- Vivid Metaphor (McKinsey × Pixar child)

## Email 4: Social Proof/Progress

**Purpose:** Show progress, early feedback, build belief

**Hook Type:** Customer Story + Transparency
**Hook:**
"Last month, I showed Jason—early customer, former McKinsey consultant—a prototype. He spent 20 minutes using it. Then he looked at me and said: 'This is illegal. It's not fair to everyone else.'"

**Core Message:**
- What we've shipped so far
- Early feedback (specific, quotable)
- This isn't vaporware—it's real and working
- Behind the scenes: the struggle to get here

**Key Techniques:**
- Customer Story (real name, specific quote)

**Hook Type:** Permission + Question
**Hook:**
"You helped us get here. Now we're building something that could change everything—and I want you with us from the beginning."

**Core Message:**
- Recognition: early customers made this possible
- The offer: early access + feedback opportunity
- What we're asking: your thoughts, your use cases, your honesty
- The stakes: this won't be cheap later, but you're family

**Key Techniques:**
- Personal recognition
- Permission to say no (anti-hard-sell)
- Scarcity (early access is limited)
- P.S. Subplot (personal note about what this means to me)

**CTA:** Get early access + join feedback sessions

**Hook Score:** 45/50
- Open Loop Power: 4×3 = 12

## Voice Guidelines

**Do:**
- Be direct and honest
- Challenge conventional presentation advice
- Give value before asking anything
- Use conversational asides in parentheses

**Don't:**
- Use corporate fluff
- Write long paragraphs
- Push hard before email 4
- Forget who bought the course (they're not cold leads)
- Use generic "hey everyone" language

## Campaign Notes

**Why this sequence works:**
1. Respects the existing relationship (they're customers, not strangers)
2. Agitates the right pain (business presentations, not speeches)
3. Paints a compelling vision (AI + McKinsey principles)
4. Shows, doesn't just tell (real customer quote)
5. Makes an offer that feels like an invitation, not a sales pitch

**What to watch:**
- Open rates dropping after email 2 = problem with relevance
- High open, low click = vision isn't compelling enough
- High click, no signups = friction in conversion flow
- Reply rate under 3% = not creating enough conversation

**Split test opportunity:**
Email 4 could test different customer stories (consultant vs. corporate vs. entrepreneur)
