## Email Body

Hey, it's Mike from SlideHeroes.

Imagine this.

You walk into a meeting with a clear recommendation in mind.

You sit down at your computer.

You start typing.

The structure forms around your ideas.

The slides create themselves.

The data visualizes automatically.

An hour later, you're done.

The presentation is clear.

The logic is sound.

The design is professional.

And you didn't spend three hours tweaking layouts or wrestling with formatting.

You just... thought.

And the thinking BECAME the presentation.

Sounds like science fiction, right?

Here's what I've been building for the past year:

We're taking the 5S Framework and giving it an engine.

**STRUCTURE** — You describe your argument. AI structures it using McKinsey principles automatically.

**STORY** — You tell it the situation, complication, and question. It crafts the narrative arc.

**SUBSTANCE** — You upload your data. It generates the right charts, with footnotes, with source citations.

**STYLE** — It applies clean, minimalist design. The kind executives actually take seriously.

**SELF-CONFIDENCE** — The better your presentation, the more confident you feel when presenting. It's a virtuous circle.

Here's the thing:

This isn't about "generating slides."

That's what ChatGPT does.

You type "make me a sales deck" and it gives you... a generic sales deck.

Generic slides. Generic structure. Generic everything.

That's not what we're building.

We're building an AI that THINKS like a McKinsey consultant.

It doesn't just create slides.

It helps you THINK better.

You outline your argument. It finds the logical gaps.

You describe your recommendation. It challenges your assumptions.

You present your data. It suggests the most compelling visualization.

It's not a tool for creating pretty slides.

It's a tool for sharpening your thinking.

Then it presents that thinking clearly.

Think about what this means:

You walk into that executive meeting.

Your deck is structured. Your argument is clear. Your data is compelling.

You spend the meeting discussing the RECOMMENDATION, not explaining the SLIDES.

Because the slides do the explaining.

So you can do the persuading.

This is what I'm talking about when I say we're building something bigger than a course.

A course teaches you the principles.

This tool applies them FOR you.

While you think.

Let me be really clear:

This is not vaporware.

It's working right now.

I've been testing it with a small group of early customers.

The results are... unexpected.

(That's the polite word for "insane.")

Tomorrow, I'll share a specific story that'll show you exactly what I mean.

Mike "future of presentations" Loomis

P.S.

One of my early testers—Jason, former McKinsey consultant, now corporate strategy VP—sent me this after his first session:

"I just created a deck in 45 minutes that would have taken me 4 hours. And honestly? It's better than what I would have made on my own."

That's not the surprising part.

The surprising part was his next line:

"It feels like cheating."

I told him it's not cheating.

It's evolution.

## Mandatory Elements Check

- [x] Personal Greeting
- [x] Short Line Rhythm
- [x] P.S. Section (strategic purpose: social proof, addresses "cheating" objection)
- [x] Clever Signature
- [x] Campaign Abbreviation
- [x] Single CTA (implicit: read next email for the story)

---

## CTA Strategy

**Primary CTA:** None explicit — engagement through curiosity about tomorrow's story
**Implicit Action:** Continue reading the series
**Why this works:** Vision email should build desire without immediate pressure. The story teaser in email 4 will be the conversion catalyst.

## Notes for Testing

**Subject line variations to test:**
- [RELAUNCH] Imagine presentations that create themselves
- [RELAUNCH] McKinsey principles, automated
- What if AI actually helped you think?

**Key differentiation message:** Emphasize that this is not a slide generator—it's a thinking tool. This is the key distinction from generic AI presentation tools.

**Objection handling:** The P.S. proactively addresses the "feels like cheating" concern, framing it as evolution instead. This objection will be common and needs to be addressed early.
