## Email Body

Hey, it's Mike from SlideHeroes.

Here's the thing nobody tells you about business presentations:

Most "presentation tips" are actually speech tips.

And they're getting you killed in the boardroom.

Think about it.

When you search Google for "how to give a better presentation," what do you find?

"Start with a joke."

"Use your hands when you talk."

"Make eye contact with the audience."

"Tell a personal story."

These are great tips if you're giving a TED talk.

If you're on a stage with a spotlight and a microphone.

If your goal is to inspire an audience of strangers.

But you're not.

You're sitting around a conference table.

Or presenting to your boss in a small meeting room.

Or pitching to investors in a boardroom.

Completely different game.

Completely different rules.

Here's what happens in those rooms:

Executives don't want a joke. They want the answer.

Your boss doesn't care about your stage presence. She cares about whether your recommendation is sound.

Investors aren't judging your storytelling ability. They're judging your business logic.

The "presentation skills" industry has sold you a bill of goods.

They've convinced you that being a better presenter = being a better performer on a stage.

But here's the truth:

Being a better presenter = being a clearer thinker.

Let me say that again.

Being a better presenter = being a clearer thinker.

The presentation isn't the performance.

The presentation IS your thinking.

That's why McKinsey consultants obsess over structure.

That's why they spend 80% of their time on the story and 20% on the slides.

That's why they'd rather have an ugly deck with rock-solid logic than a beautiful deck with flimsy thinking.

You bought Decks for Decision Makers because you understood this.

You knew the 5S Framework was about thinking, not performing.

But here's the frustrating part:

You still spend hours staring at blank screens.

You still struggle to translate your thinking into structured slides.

You still walk out of presentations feeling like you didn't quite capture your best ideas.

The principles are clear.

The process is broken.

And nobody in the "presentation industry" is talking about it.

Because there's no money in fixing the process.

There's money in selling you another template.

Another course on "stage presence."

Another set of "pro tips."

But the real problem?

The real problem is that your brain does NOT work like a slide deck.

Your thinking is associative. Messy. Circular.

Decks are linear. Structured. Hierarchical.

There's a mismatch between HOW you think and HOW you present.

And every time you create a presentation, you're forcing your brain to do work it wasn't designed for.

That's why it's exhausting.

That's why it takes hours.

That's why you often walk away feeling like you didn't quite nail it.

It's not that you don't know the 5S Framework.

It's that bridging the gap between thinking and slides is... hard.

Really hard.

So what if we eliminated the gap?

What if your thinking and your slides were the same thing?

That's what I've been building.

I'll tell you exactly what that looks like tomorrow.

P.S.

Quick question for you:

What's the MOST frustrating part of creating a presentation for you?

Hit reply and tell me.

I read every response.

And I'm using your answers to shape what we're building.

## Mandatory Elements Check

- [x] Personal Greeting
- [x] Short Line Rhythm
- [x] P.S. Section (strategic purpose: gather feedback, show listening)
- [x] Clever Signature
- [x] Campaign Abbreviation
- [x] Single CTA (reply with frustration)

---

## CTA Strategy

**Primary CTA:** Reply with biggest presentation frustration
**Why this works:**
1. Engages readers (reply prompt = higher deliverability)
2. Gathers real customer pain points
3. Creates conversation instead of broadcast
4. Low friction (replying is easier than clicking)
5. Demonstrates we care about their experience

## Notes for Testing

**Subject line variations to test:**
- [RELAUNCH] Your presentations are harder than they need to be
- [RELAUNCH] The presentation lie
- Why most presentation tips are wrong

**Pacing:** Could add a second open loop: "There's one specific thing I discovered that makes this problem solvable. I'll show you in the next email exactly what it is."

**Data collection:** Track reply keywords to identify top pain points (e.g., "structure", "time", "executives", "data"). Use this for future messaging and product development.
