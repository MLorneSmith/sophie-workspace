## Email Body

Hey, it's Mike from SlideHeroes.

When you bought Decks for Decision Makers, you did more than purchase a course.

You bet on us.

You said: "I believe these people understand presentations. I want what they're teaching."

That belief is why I'm sending this email today.

Because we're at a turning point.

The AI tool I've been telling you about?

It's real.

It's working.

And it's ready for more people.

Here's the link:

[EARLY ACCESS LINK]

Before you click, I want to tell you what happens next.

This is NOT a "buy and forget" transaction.

When you join early access, here's what I'm asking from you:

**Use it.**

Create a presentation with it this week.

Don't just poke around—actually build something you need.

**Tell me what doesn't work.**

I want the brutal truth.

"The headline generation is too verbose."

"The chart options don't include waterfall."

"The export to PDF formatting is off."

Send it to me. I read every piece of feedback.

**Tell me what DOES work.**

What surprised you? What made you say "oh, that's clever"?

I need to know the wins so we can double down on them.

**Show up to a feedback call.**

Once a month, I'm doing live Zoom sessions with early access members.

No sales pitch. Just me, a whiteboard, and your feedback.

I want to build this WITH people who actually create presentations.

Not for people who imagine they might.

Here's what you get in return:

- **Full access now** — Not a "trial." Full product.
- **Early-bird pricing** — $49/month (will be $99/month at launch)
- **Lifetime grandfathering** — If you join now, you keep $49/month forever
- **Priority feature requests** — What you ask for, I build first
- **Direct access to me** — You'll have my email for feedback

**But I also want to give you permission to say no.**

If you're in a role where you rarely create presentations anymore...

This isn't for you.

If presentations aren't a core part of your job...

Save your money.

If you're perfectly happy with your current process...

I'm glad for you, honestly.

Life is too short to pay attention to everything.

And I'd rather have 500 people who actually use this than 5,000 who don't.

But if you're still in the arena...

If you're the one people turn to when it's time to make a case to executives...

If you're the one who stays up late polishing the deck for tomorrow's board meeting...

If you're the one who cares about getting decisions made, not just giving presentations...

Then I want you with us.

You believed in us early.

I want to believe in you now.

Here's the link again:

[EARLY ACCESS LINK]

I'm limiting this to 100 early access spots.

Not as a fake scarcity tactic.

Because I genuinely want to keep the group small enough that I can actually listen to everyone.

Once 100 spots are filled, the door closes until public launch.

(I'll send an email when that happens, so you're not left wondering.)

One more thing.

The first 50 people who join get an invitation to a private kickoff call with me next week.

I'll walk through the product live.

Answer questions.

Get your first presentation built together on the call.

Small group. Interactive.

No recording.

Come if you can.

Now let me tell you what this means to me.

When I started SlideHeroes, I had a simple belief:

Business presentations matter.

The way we communicate ideas to executives determines what gets built, what gets funded, what gets prioritized.

Bad presentations → bad decisions get made

Good presentations → good decisions get made

But here's the problem:

Good presentations take too much time.

Talented people spend hours on slides instead of thinking about the actual business problem.

That's waste.

Not just time waste. Brain waste.

Ideas waste.

Potential waste.

The AI tool I've built eliminates that waste.

It takes the structure you already know (5S Framework) and applies it instantly.

So you can spend your time on the ideas.

Not the formatting.

And when ideas get the attention they deserve?

Better decisions get made.

That's the vision.

That's why I built this.

That's why I'm inviting you to be part of it.

You helped us get here.

Now let's go there together.

[EARLY ACCESS LINK]

Mike "thanks for being here from the start" Loomis

P.S.

I meant what I said about permission to say no.

If this isn't right for you right now, that's completely fine.

You're still part of the SlideHeroes family.

You'll still get updates. You'll still hear about what we're building.

If and when you're ready, the door will be there.

No pressure. No guilt. Just an invitation.

Because honestly?

I'd rather you say no now than sign up and never use it.

The right people, at the right time.

That's how you build something that matters.

## Mandatory Elements Check

- [x] Personal Greeting
- [x] Short Line Rhythm
- [x] P.S. Section (strategic purpose: reiterate permission to opt out, paradoxically increases commitment)
- [x] Clever Signature
- [x] Campaign Abbreviation
- [x] Single CTA (early access sign-up)

---

## CTA Strategy

**Primary CTA:** Click early access link → Sign up
**Secondary Asks:** Use the product, provide feedback, join feedback calls
**Why this works:**
1. Honors the existing relationship (you helped us get here)
2. Gives clear expectations (what we're asking from you)
3. Uses real scarcity (100 spots, explicitly not fake)
4. Provides strong value proposition ($49 vs $99, grandfathered)
5. Permission to leave reduces pressure, increases trust

## Notes for Testing

**Subject line variations to test:**
- [RELAUNCH] Early access (special pricing)
- [RELAUNCH] 100 spots available
- You helped us get here. Come with us.

**Pricing psychology:**
- Emphasize lifetime grandfathering ($49/mo forever)
- Show public launch price ($99/mo) for contrast
- Consider adding annual option at discount

**Urgency elements:**
- 100 spot limit
- First 50 get private kickoff call
- Pricing goes up at public launch

All are real, not manufactured scarcity.

**Follow-up sequence:**
If they click but don't sign up → Email 6: "Questions?"

If they sign up → Welcome email + onboarding sequence

If no click → Nudge email 3 days later with different angle (time savings focus)
