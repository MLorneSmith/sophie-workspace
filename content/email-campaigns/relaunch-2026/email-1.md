## Email Body

Hey, it's Mike from SlideHeroes.

We've been quiet for a while.

Not because we stopped caring about your presentations.

Because we started building something bigger.

You bought Decks for Decision Makers because you wanted to transform how you present ideas to executives.

You wanted the McKinsey method.

The 5S Framework.

The kind of presentations that actually get decisions made.

And I'm grateful you trusted us with that.

But here's the thing...

Over the past year, I've been watching how people actually USE what we taught.

And I noticed something.

The principles work.

Really well.

Structure. Story. Substance. Style. Self-confidence.

When you apply them, your presentations get better.

But there's a gap between knowing WHAT to do... and actually DOING it consistently.

You know the feeling.

You sit down to create a deck.

You remember the 5S Framework.

You try to apply it.

But somehow, three hours later...

You're staring at a blank screen.

Or slides that don't quite capture your thinking.

Or a structure that felt brilliant yesterday but looks messy today.

The principles are right there.

But the process... is still a grind.

So we went heads-down to fix it.

And I mean DEEP heads-down.

I've been in the workshop (metaphorical, but also literal) for months.

Building.

Testing.

Rethinking everything.

What I'm going to share with you over the next few days will change how you think about presentations.

It changed how I think about them.

And it's going to change how you create them.

Tomorrow, I'll tell you about the problem I discovered hiding in plain sight.

The one that makes great presentations harder than they need to be.

It's probably frustrating you right now (whether you realize it or not).

See you tomorrow.

Same time, same place.

Mike "heads down, hammer down" Loomis

P.S.

My daughter asked me yesterday why I've been working so late lately.

I told her I'm building something that will make people's jobs easier.

She thought about it for a second and said:

"Good. Adults shouldn't have to work so hard just to explain things."

She's eight.

But she gets it better than most of us do.

## Mandatory Elements Check

- [x] Personal Greeting
- [x] Short Line Rhythm
- [x] P.S. Section (strategic purpose: humanizes the sender, shows personal stake)
- [x] Clever Signature
- [x] Campaign Abbreviation
- [x] Single CTA (implicit: read next email)

---

## CTA Strategy

**Primary CTA:** None explicit — engagement through open loop
**Implicit Action:** Watch for tomorrow's email
**Why this works:** First email in re-engagement sequence should be warm and non-transactional. The CTA is to continue reading the series.

---

## Notes for Testing

**Subject line variations to test:**
- [RELAUNCH] We've been quiet (here's why)
- [RELAUNCH] Building something new...
- Hey from SlideHeroes → [RELAUNCH] tag

**Pacing:** Consider adding a second open loop about a specific feature ("There's one feature in particular that Jason from McKinsey said 'changes everything' — I'll tell you which one in Email 3")
