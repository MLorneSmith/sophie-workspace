## Email Body

Hey, it's Mike from SlideHeroes.

So yesterday I told you about Jason.

Former McKinsey consultant.

Now VP of Corporate Strategy at a Fortune 500 company.

Last month, I showed him what we've been building.

He was skeptical.

(He's spent 20 years crafting presentations the hard way. Why would he trust an AI to do it?)

I told him: "Just try it. Use it to create one deck. If it sucks, tell me why."

He sat down at 9:15 AM.

He walked out at 10:00 AM.

Forty-five minutes.

One deck.

Complete.

But the time savings isn't the interesting part.

He sent me the deck.

I opened it.

And honestly? It was better than what I would have created manually.

Structure was tighter than his typical work.

Charts were more compelling.

The story arc was clearer.

Here's what Jason told me after:

"I just created a deck in 45 minutes that would have taken me 4 hours."

(We talked about this in yesterday's P.S.)

Then he paused.

And he said this:

"It feels like cheating."

That's when I knew we had something.

Here's the thing:

When someone who's spent two decades mastering a craft says your tool feels like "cheating"...

That's not a problem.

That's a product-market fit signal.

But Jason's not the only one.

Let me share a few more results:

**Sarah** — Senior Manager, consulting firm
Used the tool for a client proposal. Won the engagement.
Her quote: "The partner said it was the clearest proposal he'd seen in years."

**Marcus** — Entrepreneur, Series B startup
Used it for an investor deck. Raised the round.
His words: "I spent the prep time on the business, not the slides. It showed."

**Elena** — Director, Fortune 500 tech company
Uses it weekly now for internal presentations.
Her feedback: "My team actually looks FORWARD to my presentations now."

Now, here's the transparency part:

This didn't happen by magic.

I spent months wrestling with prompts.

I tested countless variations.

I worked with a small group of beta testers who sent me brutal, honest feedback.

"Structure is good but the headlines are too long."

"Charts are clean but the axes are wrong."

"It's great for strategy decks but doesn't work for financial models yet."

So we fixed the headlines.

We corrected the axes.

We're still building the financial model features.

(Software is never "done.")

But what we have right now?

It works.

And I'm not just saying that.

Real people. Real decks. Real results.

Here's what I've noticed about the people who get the most value from this:

They're not looking for a magic button.

They're looking for a way to spend more time THINKING and less time TWEAKING.

They already know the principles (you bought DDM, so you do too).

They just want the principles applied automatically.

So they can focus on the ideas.

Not the formatting.

This is where we are right now:

We're in private beta with about 50 users.

We're shipping features every week.

We're learning fast.

And I want to open this up to you.

As a SlideHeroes customer who's been with us from the beginning.

I'm opening up a limited number of early access spots.

Here's what early access includes:

- Full access to the product
- Priority on feature requests
- Monthly feedback calls with me directly
- A special early-bird pricing tier that won't be available to the public

This isn't a "launch" with fake scarcity.

This is genuinely limited because we're still building and I want to keep the beta group small enough that I can actually listen to everyone.

I'll send you the link tomorrow.

In the meantime, I have a question for you.

If you had this tool, what's the FIRST presentation you'd create with it?

Hit reply and tell me.

I'd love to hear about what you're working on.

Mike "early and often" Loomis

P.S.

One thing Jason said that I haven't shared yet:

After using the tool for a few weeks, he told me something unexpected.

"The weird thing is, my THINKING has gotten better too."

I asked him what he meant.

He said: "When the tool structures my ideas automatically, I can see the gaps in my logic. It's like having a consultant looking over my shoulder, pointing out where my argument doesn't hold together."

That wasn't something I designed.

It's something that emerged.

And honestly?

It might be the most valuable feature we didn't know we were building.

## Mandatory Elements Check

- [x] Personal Greeting
- [x] Short Line Rhythm
- [x] P.S. Section (strategic purpose: unexpected benefit that deepens value)
- [x] Clever Signature
- [x] Campaign Abbreviation
- [x] Single CTA (reply with first presentation idea + implicit interest in early access)

---

## CTA Strategy

**Primary CTA:** Reply with the first presentation they'd create
**Secondary CTA:** Prepare for tomorrow's early access link
**Why this works:**
1. Reply prompt gathers valuable use case data
2. Creates engagement before the conversion email
3. Shows we're interested in their specific needs
4. Low friction — replying is easier than clicking

## Notes for Testing

**Subject line variations to test:**
- [RELAUNCH] "It feels like cheating" (Jason's story)
- [RELAUNCH] What 45-minute presentations look like
- Real results from real customers

**Customer story diversity:** Four stories cover different personas:
- Jason: McKinsey/Corporate executive
- Sarah: Consulting / client work
- Marcus: Entrepreneur / investor pitching
- Elena: Internal presentations / team comms

This breadth helps more readers see themselves in the results.

**"Cheating" objection addressed:** The P.S. readdresses the "cheating" concern from email 3 but flips it—now "cheating" has a hidden benefit (better thinking).
