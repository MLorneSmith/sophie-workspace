## Conversation Summary

assistant: Build complete. Now switching to production mode:
assistant: Port conflict - let me clean up the old process:
assistant: Running in production mode now. Let me verify it's healthy:
assistant: Done! Mission Control is now running in **production mode**. 

The random refreshes were caused by webpack HMR failing to connect (404s) and triggering full page reloads as a fallback. Production mode has no HMR, so this won't happen anymore.

Give it a try - should be stable now. 🦁
