user: [Discord Guild #general channel id:1466532593754312899 +10m 2026-02-05 16:17 UTC] slideheroes: When working on the 2025slideheroes code, it is improtant to be working on the most recent version of the code. I guess this will require you to pull changes. Can you add this to your memory as a SOP?

assistant: Added to MEMORY.md! 📝

**SOP: Working on 2025slideheroes**
- Always `git fetch upstream` and merge before starting work
- Create feature branches from `upstream/dev`
- Push to my fork, then PR to main repo's `dev`

I'll follow this every time I touch the codebase. 🦁
