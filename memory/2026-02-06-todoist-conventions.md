assistant: Hey Mike! 👋 What would you like to work on?
user: [Discord Guild #general channel id:1466532593754312899 +45s 2026-02-06 18:13 UTC] slideheroes: Sophie, In Todoist I have a task to 'Define Todoist task conventions (P1/P2, due-date default Friday, short imperative): Agreed: use Todoist priorities; default due date = this Friday when unspecified; task names short imperative.'. what is this about? Is this complete?

assistant: Found it! This is from a Todoist review I did on January 31st. The task is essentially a **meta-task documenting conventions we agreed on** for how to manage Todoist tasks going forward:

**The conventions:**
1. **Use Todoist priorities properly** — P1/P2 for truly urgent, P3/P4 for nice-to-do and someday/maybe (not everything P1)
2. **Default due date = this Friday** when no specific deadline is given (creates weekly review pressure)
3. **Task names: short imperative** — e.g., "Evaluate Huuman for bookkeeping" not "Investigate [long link]..." (links go in description)

Since the task description already contains "Agreed:" with the conventions spelled out, this looks like it was created as a **record of the decision**, not an action item. The conventions are documented.

**My recommendation:** Yes, mark it complete ✅ — the conventions are defined (in the task itself and in my memory). The real work is *following* them going forward, not defining them.

Want me to mark it done in Todoist?
