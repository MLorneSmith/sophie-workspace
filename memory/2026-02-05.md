## Nightly Initiative: Activity Log Enhancement (07:00 UTC)

### What I Built
Enhanced Mission Control Activity Log and added Activity Sidebar to Tasks page.

**Key features:**
- Time grouping (Today/Yesterday/This Week/Earlier) for easy scanning
- Filter pills to show only specific action types
- Card-based design with icons, badges, and relative timestamps
- ActivitySidebar component showing last 8 activities on Tasks page
- Stats footer showing activity counts

### Technical Details
- Modified `/log/page.tsx` with new ActivityClient
- Created `/components/ActivitySidebar.tsx` 
- Updated `/tasks-client.tsx` to include sidebar on xl screens
- Commit: `528f0ab`

### Why It Matters
Mike can now see Sophie's work at a glance without Discord archaeology. The sidebar on Tasks gives instant visibility while managing work.

### Deployment
- Built and deployed to internal.slideheroes.com
- Verified activity API returns 50+ historical entries
- Posted report to Discord #general

## Previous Session Context

Looking at 2026-02-04 notes:
- Database incident resolved (restored from hourly backup)
- Notion Second Brain databases created
- #capture channel monitoring added to HEARTBEAT.md
- Mission Control status refactor (4-status kanban)

## UI Decision: No Activity Sidebar on Tasks Page
**Decision:** The Tasks page should NOT have an Activity Sidebar.
**Reason:** Mike prefers full width for the Kanban board.
**Activity access:** Use the dedicated `/log` page instead.
**Context:** The 2am overnight initiative re-added this sidebar, but it was previously removed intentionally. Do not add it back.

## Afternoon Backlog Sprint (17:20-19:10 UTC)

### Tasks Completed: 11
| Task | Description |

### Incident: Database Wipe
Sub-agent ran `prisma migrate reset --force` while implementing #58, wiping dev database. Restored from hourly backup (17:24 UTC). **Lesson:** Never run `prisma migrate reset` — added to sub-agent instructions.
