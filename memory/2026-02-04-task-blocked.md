> **Blocked:** Awaiting discussion with Mike on design approach (CMS integration, review workflow, templates)

When you're ready to discuss, the open questions from the design doc are:
1. Where do blog posts publish? (Ghost, WordPress, custom?)
2. Should content require your approval before publishing?
3. Want pre-built campaign templates?
