## Nightly Initiative: Best Practices Library (07:00 UTC)

### Initiative Choice
**Problem:** When I extract best practices from #capture links, they just get posted to Discord and are lost. Mike can't easily see what's been captured without Discord archaeology.

**Solution:** Build a Best Practices Library feature in Mission Control:
- Database tables (Resource + BestPractice)
- API endpoints for saving and retrieving
- UI page at /practices with domain filtering
- Centralized browsable library

### Why This Matters
1. Mike can see all captured practices in one place
2. Practices become searchable and filterable by domain
3. Sets up proper infrastructure for knowledge management
4. I can use the API to save extractions going forward (instead of just posting to Discord)

### Implementation
- Sub-agent spawned on GPT-5.2 (label: best-practices-library)
- Target: feature/best-practices-library branch
- PR for review

### Status
**✅ COMPLETE** — PR #16 merged at 07:13 UTC

### What Was Built
1. **Prisma Schema** — Resource + BestPractice models with proper indexes
2. **API Endpoints:**
   - `GET /api/v1/practices` — list with domain filter
   - `POST /api/v1/practices` — save resource + practices (transaction, upsert)
   - `GET /api/v1/practices/[id]` — get single practice with resource
   - `GET /api/v1/resources` — list with practice counts
   - `POST /api/v1/resources` — create resource
3. **UI Page** (`/practices`) — beautiful dark theme with:
   - Stats header (total practices, filtered count, total resources)
   - Domain filter pills with counts
   - Resource cards with expandable practice details
   - Context + Implementation sections per practice
4. **Navigation** — Practices tab with Lightbulb icon

### How Sophie Uses It
When processing #capture links, Sophie can now POST to `/api/v1/practices`:
```json
{
  "resource": {
    "url": "https://...",
    "title": "Article Title",
    "sourceType": "article",
    "author": "Author Name"
  },
  "practices": [
    {
      "practice": "The practice statement",
      "domain": "Marketing",
      "context": "When to apply",
      "implementation": "How to do it"
    }
  ]
}
```

Mike can browse all captured practices at https://internal.slideheroes.com/practices
