- **brainstorming** — mandatory before creative/feature work
- **find-skills** — discover & install new skills
- **frontend-design** — production-grade UI design

- **tailwind-design-system** — design systems with Tailwind v4
- **vercel-react-best-practices** — React/Next.js performance patterns
- **qmd** — local hybrid search for markdown notes

Plus the usual built-ins (github, notion, gog, slack, etc.). Nice collection! The brainstorming one being mandatory before creative work is a good guardrail. 🦁
