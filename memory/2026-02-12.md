## [00:00] Session Compaction — State Capture

### BigQuery + Supabase Pipeline Live
- 30 Supabase tables synced to BigQuery `staging` dataset (122 rows)
- Nightly cron at 6 AM ET (cron `72cf0587-9ce1-4b1d-bfa2-70922ae599a5`)
- Supabase must use pooler URL (IPv6 issue with direct)
- Next: Stripe → BigQuery (#427, needs API creds from Mike)

### Blog Pipeline Fully Built
- 8 commands: ideate → strategy → research → brief → outline → write → qa → publish
- DataForSEO balance depleted (-$0.05) — blocks keyword research
- GSC connected (sophie@slideheroes.com, Full permission)
- First real post blocked on #448 (app positioning discussion with Mike)

### Content Pillars — 8 Proposed, Pending Mike Approval (#450)
- Confirmed 5 + proposed 3 from pillar research (#449)
- Target: 20 posts/month across 8 pillars

### Key Blockers
- **Billing error**: Main session on depleted `anthropic:manual` key, needs switch to `anthropic:claude-cli`
- **#448**: App positioning discussion needed before blog content
- **#450**: Pillar brainstorm session with Mike
- **#427**: Stripe API credentials needed
- **DataForSEO**: Balance depleted, needs $10-20 top-up

### Fallback Model Changed
- GLM 4.7 → GPT 5.2 Codex as cross-provider fallback (Mike's request)
- Known issue: mid-tool-call failover breaks (GPT can't match `toolu_*` IDs)

### Overnight Work Queue
- 5-email relaunch sequence, Context Tab improvements, Council v2, presentation eval pipeline, Docs cleanup
- Nightly crons: 11pm ET backlog, 2am ET proactive
