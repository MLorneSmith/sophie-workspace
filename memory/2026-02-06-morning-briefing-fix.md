## Conversation Summary

assistant: Found the usage data. Now let me update the morning routine to include all three items:
assistant: All fixed. Updated `state/ROUTINES.md` with:

1. **Weather → Celsius** — Now uses `wttr.in` with the `m` (metric) flag
2. **LLM Usage reporting** — Added step to aggregate token usage by model from sessions data (shows % split)
3. **Meetings section** — Made explicit that Today's and Tomorrow's meetings are REQUIRED fields (even if "No meetings scheduled")

Tomorrow's brief will include all three. 👍

assistant: You're right — I must have used localhost when generating today's brief instead of the actual URL. Let me verify the template in ROUTINES.md is correct:
assistant: The template in ROUTINES.md is correct (`internal.slideheroes.com`), so this was my execution error when generating today's brief — I used localhost instead of following the template.

My mistake. Tomorrow's brief will use the correct URLs:
