The **haircut-booking** skill is also ready for next time — just say "book me a haircut" and I'll handle it! 💈

assistant: Ah, you're right! I'm only set up with `sophie@slideheroes.com`, not your personal Gmail. 

So I can't verify the Setmore confirmation email — but the booking **is confirmed** (we saw the confirmation page with booking ID CYCTRMVE), and I've added it to your calendar as backup.

Want me to set up access to your personal Gmail too? That would let me fully complete the email verification step in the skill. Otherwise, I can update the skill to skip that check since the calendar backup already covers you.
user: [Discord Guild #general channel id:1466532593754312899 +29s 2026-02-02 19:49 UTC] slideheroes: update the skill to not do that check
[message_id: 1467970323570888724]
assistant: Done. Simplified the workflow — now it just adds the calendar event directly after booking, without trying to check your personal email. ✅
