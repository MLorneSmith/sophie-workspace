Instead of a PR for me to review, we should follow the new process we just create: Delegate coding to a GPT agent, add what you build to internal-tools repo, you review the PR and fix or approve. I will logon and review each morning. I want to wake up every morning and be like "wow, you got a lot done while I was sleeping." Don't be afraid to monitor my business and build things that would help improve our workflow. Every night when I go to bed, build something cool out I can test.
