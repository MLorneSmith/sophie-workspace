## Conversation Summary

assistant: Server's back up. Let me test the auto-logging now:
assistant: 🎉 Working! Task creation now auto-logs to the activity feed.

Let me clean up the test tasks:
assistant: All done! ✅ 

**What I changed:** Added auto-logging to the task creation API — now whenever a task is created, it automatically adds a `task_created` entry to the Log Tab with the task name, board, and priority.

No more relying on my memory — it's baked into the system. 🦁
