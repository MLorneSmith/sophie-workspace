## Conversation Summary

assistant: It's working! I can see your Readwise highlights syncing:

**Article:** "Agentic GTM Requires Systems, Not Smarter Agents" by Rick Koleta

**Your highlights:**
1. *"A Unified System of Context"* — Agentic GTM requires a single, continuously updated account-level view that every function operates from
2. *"A System of Orchestration"* — Agents require explicit rules that govern behavior across teams, channels, and moments
3. *"A Clear Activation and Control Surface"* — Humans remain accountable; system must surface clear, prioritized actions

The Readwise → Notion pipeline is live. 🎉

**What now?** Two options:

1. **Keep it simple:** Your highlights live in the Readwise section of Notion. When you want best practices extracted, share the article link to #capture and I'll process it.

2. **Automate more:** I can periodically check your Readwise library and auto-extract best practices into our Best Practices database.

Which approach sounds better? (I'd recommend starting with #1 — you stay in control of what gets processed.)
