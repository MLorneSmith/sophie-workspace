# 2026-02-10 — Session Notes

## Tasks Completed
- **#222 Orchestrator Refactor** — marked done (Mike said it was already complete)
- **#345 Review context files (22 files)** — sub-agent reviewed, report at `deliverables/context-files-review.md`. Overall well-maintained, main issue was outdated Codex workflow in MEMORY.md
- **#346 Review agent profiles (8 profiles)** — sub-agent reviewed, report at `deliverables/agent-profiles-review.md`. All 8 profiles have correct model assignments. README table had wrong models for writer/emailer/designer (said Opus, actually GLM)
- **#348 Integrate Sophie Loop into nightly cron jobs** — Updated both nightly cron payloads (11pm backlog + 2am initiatives) to use Sophie Loop (loop-runner.py) builder→reviewer workflow instead of raw `codex exec --full-auto`. Also fixed coder.yaml stale notes.

## Fixes Applied
- MEMORY.md: Updated "Coding Sub-Agent Strategy" section — removed old `.ai/bin/codex/` references, documented Sophie Loop workflow
- MEMORY.md: Fixed `~/.ai/` → `~/clawd/.ai/` path references
- `.ai/agents/README.md`: Fixed model table (writer/emailer/designer → GLM 4.7)
- `~/clawd/README.md`: Replaced "Test" with actual workspace description
- IDENTITY.md: Removed unused avatar line
- AGENTS.md: Clarified BOOTSTRAP.md is only for first setup
- `.ai/agents/coder.yaml`: Updated notes section to reference Sophie Loop instead of old Codex scripts

## Tasks In Progress (sub-agents still running at compaction)
- **#146 Competitive intelligence: research AI presentation tools** — GLM sub-agent doing web research, label: `competitive-intel`
- **#159 Create Content Context system** — GLM sub-agent building content pillars/types/clusters, label: `content-context`
- **#170 Review SlideHeroes Manifesto** — COMPLETED. Review at `deliverables/manifesto-review.md`. Key finding: manifesto needs 30-40% trim, too academic in middle chapters, ending needs conviction not process. Suggested adding social proof (Mike's background, Seneca, US DoE).

## Cron Job Updates
- Nightly Backlog (11pm ET) `a044c4ca-bd10-4564-8ea9-f86a82777307` — payload updated with Sophie Loop workflow
- Nightly Initiatives (2am ET) `daaaeb2e-1b5e-4dda-9d47-ef426712e423` — payload updated with Sophie Loop workflow

## All 4 Prioritized Tasks Complete
- **#348** Sophie Loop → nightly cron ✅
- **#146** Competitive intel → `deliverables/competitive-intelligence-ai-presentations.md` ✅
- **#159** Content Context system → 5 files in `.ai/contexts/content/` + skill-mappings updated ✅
- **#170** Manifesto review → `deliverables/manifesto-review.md` ✅

## Competitive Intel Key Findings
- 13+ AI presentation tools analyzed
- No consulting-specialized competitor doing storyboard-first + knowledge engine
- Pricing benchmarks: $8-50/user/mo market range
- Recommended SlideHeroes beta pricing: $39-49/user/mo individual, $79-99 team

## Data Ecosystem Initiative Discussion
Mike shared a Claude conversation about customer data architecture (Apollo → BigQuery → Attio).
- Architecture: BigQuery = TAM/ICP universe backbone, Attio = active pipeline only, Apollo feeds BigQuery not Attio
- Proposed 16 tasks across 5 phases (Foundation → Pipelines → Transformation → Reverse ETL → Closed Loop)
- Maps to existing tasks #105, #202, #268, #178
- Recommendation: defer Apollo/TAM until post-beta, focus on product data + billing pipelines first
- Mike hasn't yet confirmed whether to create the tasks in MC

## Todoist Sync — Fixed API Migration (Feb 10-11)
Todoist deprecated Sync API v9, moved to unified API v1.
- **Endpoint:** `api.todoist.com/sync/v9/sync` → `api.todoist.com/api/v1/sync`
- **Breaking change:** Item IDs changed from numeric ("10005586409") to alphanumeric strings ("6fxPJMq98Qf6rjMM")
- **Fix applied:** Updated `~/clawd/scripts/sync-mc-todoist.sh` endpoint + removed `|tonumber` casts for Todoist IDs
- **Migration script:** `~/clawd/scripts/migrate-todoist-ids.sh` — re-linked 77 MC↔Todoist tasks by name matching
- **Full sync ran:** 120 tasks updated, 34 closed in Todoist. All MC changes from tonight reflected.
- **Cron job:** `5609eb91` (MC ↔ Todoist Sync, every 30 min 7am-11pm ET) should work going forward
- **Note:** ~77 old MC tasks with numeric todoistIds were unmatched (mostly done/deleted tasks) — harmless

## Billing Error — ROOT CAUSE FOUND
- **Problem:** Every Discord message delivery shows "API provider returned a billing error"
- **Root cause:** Main session is bound to `anthropic:manual` auth profile (token `sk-ant…uPTQAA` — depleted) instead of `anthropic:claude-cli` (OAuth/subscription)
- `session_status()` confirmed: `🔑 token sk-ant…uPTQAA (anthropic:manual)`
- ZAI API key is fine (tested via curl)
- **Fix needed:** Switch main session from `anthropic:manual` to `anthropic:claude-cli` in OpenClaw config, restart gateway

## Config Change Investigation
- `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` last modified 2026-02-10 16:14 UTC
- Meta field shows `lastTouchedVersion: "2026.2.9"`, `lastTouchedAt: "2026-02-10T16:10:32"`
- Wizard last ran on `2026.2.6-3` (doctor command, Feb 8)
- Auto-update cron (session `23bcb544`) ran at 11:30 UTC → updated from `2026.2.6-3` → `2026.2.9`
- ~5 hour gap between update session and config modification timestamp — unclear what touched config at 16:14
- Session files in `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/` (JSONL format) — searched but got noise from node_modules listings
- **Hypothesis:** The version upgrade from 2026.2.6-3 → 2026.2.9 likely re-ran config migration that switched the auth profile
- **Next step:** Fix the auth profile and monitor if it stays correct after future updates

## Sophie Loop — Production Test PASSED (#347)
Full end-to-end test of the builder→reviewer iteration loop completed successfully.

**Flow:**
- Iteration 1: GLM builder wrote blog post (~1,750 words) → auto-checks flagged missing CTA
- Iteration 2: Opus reviewer → FAIL (4 SEO gaps: no internal links, no external link, no meta description, no featured image alt text). Content quality praised.
- Iteration 3: GLM builder revised with all feedback → auto-checks passed → Opus reviewer → **PASS**

**Bug found & fixed:** `loop-runner.py` `parse_verdict()` only checked first 2000 chars of review text. Reviews longer than that returned UNKNOWN. Fixed to search full text for `VERDICT: PASS/FAIL` pattern first.

**Deliverable:** `deliverables/content/blog/boardroom-presentation-structure.md`
**Run artifacts:** `.ai/runs/347/`

**Validation:** Context loading, builder→reviewer iteration, auto-checks (CTA, word count), reviewer catching SEO issues, feedback incorporation, verdict parsing, MC status updates — all working.

## Data Ecosystem Tasks Created (#420-#435)
Created all 16 tasks under initiative #105 in Mission Control. 5 phases: Foundation → Inbound Pipelines → Transformation → Reverse ETL → Closed Loop.

Plan documented: `deliverables/data-ecosystem-initiative-plan.md`

Architecture: Apollo → BigQuery (TAM backbone) → Attio (qualified records only). Census recommended for reverse ETL.

Near-term priority: Tasks 1-2 (BigQuery setup, entity model), 7-8 (Supabase + Stripe pipelines). Apollo/TAM deferred to post-beta.

## ICP Scoring — Three-Circle Venn Framework (#422)

Mike shared a GTM podcast (https://youtu.be/zuCh9jTgz8g) featuring Sohom (RevOps expert). Key framework:

**Three separate scores, look at the overlap:**
1. **ICP/Firmographic Score** — Static fit: industry, size, technographics
2. **Engagement Score** — Interaction with YOUR content: website, events, emails, content downloads
3. **Readiness Score** — Narrowest but most powerful: pricing page visits, compliance page checks, job posting velocity, website changes indicating active need

**Key insight:** No single circle matters alone. The intersection of all three = "talk to these accounts NOW." Score them SEPARATELY, don't mash into one composite number.

**6 hypotheses proposed for SlideHeroes:**
1. "Consulting DNA" firmographic fit (consulting/advisory = highest)
2. "Sweet Spot" company size (5-200 employees)
3. "PowerPoint Pain" technographic signal (PPT users without presentation tools)
4. "Content Velocity" behavioral trigger (presentation created <48h, reference upload)
5. "Decision-Maker" role fit (Partner/Principal/Director = buyers)
6. "Trigger Event" intent signals (funding, hiring, job posts mentioning presentations)

Hypotheses 1-3,5 map to Circle 1 (ICP), 4 maps to Circle 2 (Engagement), 6 maps to Circle 3 (Readiness).

**Research saved:** `deliverables/icp-scoring-research.md` (5 methodologies, 9 case studies, 15+ sources)

**Next step:** Mike wants to discuss SlideHeroes-specific criteria, then restructure scoring around the three circles.

## ICP Scoring — Refinements with Mike
During the discussion, Mike validated and adjusted scoring criteria:
- **Industry:** Corporate strategy teams → +20 (up from +10), Business development → +10 (new)
- **Company size:** Ceiling raised to 500 (other signals filter out large cos), tiers simplified
- **Technographics:** DROPPED — PowerPoint detection unreliable (everyone has M365). Replaced with "presentation-heavy role density" using Apollo job title data as proxy
- **Circle 2 Engagement:** Integrated Aakash Gupta's Activation Ladder (Rung 1: AI-assisted, Rung 2: user-driven). SlideHeroes-specific activation moments TBD → task #436
- **Circle 3 Readiness:** Separated cleanly from Circle 2. Now purely buying intent signals. Phased: own product data at beta → low-cost external → expensive providers later
- **Overlap matrix actions:** Deferred to task #437 — needs deep design work intersecting with content engine and outbound email

## New Tasks Created
- **#436** — Design SlideHeroes activation moments (AI-Assisted + User-Driven) — high priority
- **#437** — Design scoring-triggered motions (overlap matrix → automated actions) — high priority
- **#438** — Redesign flow and UI of agentic slide deck workflow — high priority, initiative #15
- **#439** — Evaluate on-page technical SEO tools (Screaming Frog-like, open-source focus) — low priority

## Initiative #15 "Ship the Core Product Experience" — Reorganized
- Linked 10 orphan product tasks to initiative #15
- Consolidated duplicates: #98→#327 (storyboard), #99→#325 (dashboard), #332 reopened (website homepage ≠ app dashboard)
- #362 (marketing homepage design) set to high priority under #15
- #330 (Ragie) moved to "Build the Knowledge Engine" initiative #17
- #105 moved to "Build the Customer Data Ecosystem" initiative #11
- #334, #336 (CI/CD debugging) marked done
- All 16 data ecosystem tasks (#420-#435) linked to initiative #11
- Final count: 13 tasks in initiative #15 (6 high, 7 medium), no duplicates

## Task Updates
- **#119** (Fix Kopia backup) — removed from MC, personal task
- **#423** — expanded scope to full ETL landscape scan (not just Census vs Hightouch). Completed: 20+ tools evaluated, recommendation Portable + Hightouch ($550/mo) or budget Weld ($79/mo). Deliverable: `deliverables/etl-reverse-etl-evaluation.md`
- **#163** — narrowed to SEO content optimization tools (Surfer-like), must include open-source alternatives, deprioritized to low
- **#350** — Context maintenance process designed + implemented (freshness.json, corrections-log.md, 3 modes: reactive/proactive/feedback)
- **#351** — Feedback learning loop designed, learned_rules added to writer.yaml, corrections-log.md created

## Billing Error Workaround
Discord replies via normal response don't always go through (billing error on anthropic:manual). Using `message` tool to send directly to Discord channel works as workaround. Still need to fix the auth profile.

## Entity Model Complete (#421)
Unified entity model designed: `deliverables/unified-entity-model.md`
- 6 core entities + 3 fact tables with full BigQuery DDL
- Canonical ID strategy (cph_/pph_ UUIDs)
- Dedup strategy with confidence scoring
- ICP scoring table (firmographic, behavioral, intent components)
- MVL qualification view for reverse ETL to Attio
- 7-phase implementation checklist
