## Nightly Work Session (~11pm ET / 04:00Z Feb 1)
### Todoist Review (Completed ✅)
- Analyzed full Todoist setup: 43 projects, 8 labels, 36 sections, 200+ active tasks
- Created comprehensive review with recommendations: `memory/todoist-review-2026-01-31.md`
- Key findings:
  - Good project hierarchy but some duplicates from Akiflow migration (Zach, Home, Christmas Presents appear twice)
  - Labels underutilized for Sophie coordination (only networking labels exist)
  - Priorities mostly P1 (defeats purpose), due dates often missing
  - Suggested adding `@sophie`, `@from-sophie`, `@waiting` labels for coordination
  - Proposed filters: 🐸 Today's Frog, 🤖 For Sophie, ⏳ Waiting, 📅 This Week, etc.
  - Recommended daily workflow: morning frog selection + evening inbox clear

### SlideHeroes Nightly Work (Skipped ⚠️)
- Nightly cron job triggered for proactive SlideHeroes work
- **Did not proceed** because USER.md explicitly says: "Do not touch (make changes to) the 2025slideheroes project on GitHub unless Mike explicitly asks"
- A cron job is not the same as "Mike explicitly asking" - it's an automated trigger
- Flagged to Mike: if he wants me to do nightly SlideHeroes work, he should update USER.md to grant that permission

- Cron task requested: Tonight after 11pm Toronto time (≈ 04:00Z Feb 1), review Mike's Todoist setup post-Akiflow migration and produce recommendations (taxonomy/naming/priorities/labels/filters/due-date hygiene/recurring/inbox processing/GTD workflow + chat→Todoist routing). Do NOT modify tasks/projects unless Mike explicitly asks.
- Tried scheduling via cron tool + `clawdbot cron add`; gateway cron calls timed out. Added a one-off heartbeat checklist item instead so it still happens tonight.

## Telegram
- Enabled Telegram channel; bot is @SlideHeroesSophieBot
- Approved Mike's Telegram pairing (user id 8007270788)

## Todoist
- Added Valentine's Day gift task (Longchamp cardholder) for Mon Feb 9 @ 9am Toronto
- Added 6 parent tasks with subtasks for App Build (Dashboard, CI/CD, Email, Blog Posts, OpenClaw, Update Todoist Tasks)
- Created "Ideas (migrated)" project in Todoist
- Migrated 8 "idea list" tasks → Notion pages under "Idea Lists (from Todoist)" container

## Mission Control (ClawDeck blueprint)
- Mike decided to use ClawDeck as a design + API blueprint (not as runtime)
- Implemented Prisma + SQLite schema for Boards, Tasks, Activity
- Task statuses: inbox | up_next | in_progress | in_review | done
- Built API routes matching ClawDeck semantics (boards, tasks, assign/unassign/complete)
- Build is green; next step is kanban UI

## Model preferences (locked in)
- **Default (Sophie):** Opus 4.5 — conversation, planning, research, complex reasoning
- **Coding sub-agents:** GPT-5.2 — spawn with this for implementation work
- **Coding fallback:** GLM 4.7 — use if GPT-5.2 fails
- **Basic/slow tasks:** GLM 4.7 — bulk processing, scheduled jobs, drafts, data extraction, translation, async reviews, research summaries
