- Cron task requested: Tonight after 11pm Toronto time (≈ 04:00Z Feb 1), review Mike's Todoist setup post-Akiflow migration and produce recommendations (taxonomy/naming/priorities/labels/filters/due-date hygiene/recurring/inbox processing/GTD workflow + chat→Todoist routing). Do NOT modify tasks/projects unless Mike explicitly asks.
- Tried scheduling via cron tool + `clawdbot cron add`; gateway cron calls timed out. Added a one-off heartbeat checklist item instead so it still happens tonight.

## Telegram
- Enabled Telegram channel; bot is @SlideHeroesSophieBot
- Approved Mike's Telegram pairing (user id 8007270788)

## Todoist
- Added Valentine's Day gift task (Longchamp cardholder) for Mon Feb 9 @ 9am Toronto
- Added 6 parent tasks with subtasks for App Build (Dashboard, CI/CD, Email, Blog Posts, OpenClaw, Update Todoist Tasks)
- Created "Ideas (migrated)" project in Todoist
- Migrated 8 "idea list" tasks → Notion pages under "Idea Lists (from Todoist)" container

## Mission Control (ClawDeck blueprint)
- Mike decided to use ClawDeck as a design + API blueprint (not as runtime)
- Implemented Prisma + SQLite schema for Boards, Tasks, Activity
- Task statuses: inbox | up_next | in_progress | in_review | done
- Built API routes matching ClawDeck semantics (boards, tasks, assign/unassign/complete)
- Build is green; next step is kanban UI

## Model preferences (locked in)
- **Default (Sophie):** Opus 4.5 — conversation, planning, research, complex reasoning
- **Coding sub-agents:** GPT-5.2 — spawn with this for implementation work
- **Coding fallback:** GLM 4.7 — use if GPT-5.2 fails
- **Basic/slow tasks:** GLM 4.7 — bulk processing, scheduled jobs, drafts, data extraction, translation, async reviews, research summaries
