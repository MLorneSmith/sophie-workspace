## Conversation Summary

user: [Discord Guild #general channel id:1466532593754312899 +25m 2026-02-04 01:57 UTC] slideheroes: This task should be in Todoist, not Mission Control. Mission Control is for your tasks
[message_id: 1468425191301316679]
assistant: Got it — Mission Control = Sophie's tasks, Todoist = your tasks. Let me fix that.
assistant: Fixed — removed from Mission Control and added to your Todoist (Personal project). Good to know the distinction going forward!
assistant: **☀️ Morning Brief — Tuesday, February 4, 2026**
