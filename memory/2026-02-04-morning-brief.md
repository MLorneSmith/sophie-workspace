## Conversation Summary

assistant: Now let me update the Morning Brief to split section 7:
assistant: Done! Here's the new nightly schedule:

| Time | Job | Focus |
|------|-----|-------|
| **11pm ET** | Nightly Backlog Work | Clear in-progress → backlog tasks (2hr max) |
| **2am ET** | Nightly New Initiatives | Proactive improvements, surprise Mike (2hr max) |
| **7am ET** | Morning Brief | Now includes split sections 7 & 8 |

**Morning Brief updated sections:**
- **#7 Overnight Backlog Progress** — tasks completed, PRs merged, pending items
- **#8 Overnight New Initiatives** — what I built, why it matters, what to review

Tonight's the first run with the new structure. I've got 6 backlog tasks queued up for 11pm, and at 2am I'll find something meaningful to build. 🌙

[message_id: 1468611846142427136]
assistant: Current criteria from the prompt: "AI/LLMs, local AI, Claude Code, startups/SaaS, Canada macro, Toronto news" — it's topic-based but not prioritized.

Let me tighten this up:
assistant: Updated! Now **3 headlines**, with clear prioritized selection criteria:

1. **Direct SlideHeroes impact** — AI presentation tools, SaaS GTM, consulting market
2. **AI/LLM developments** — especially Claude, agentic AI, coding assistants
3. **Canada/Toronto business** — things that affect operations

Generic tech news gets skipped unless truly significant. Each headline will include why it matters to you specifically, not just "this happened."
user: [Discord Guild #general channel id:1466532593754312899 +4m 2026-02-04 14:23 UTC] slideheroes: This is good. Here is a slight refinement: 1. Direct SlideHeroes impact — New AI presentation tools, SaaS GTM, AEO 2. AI/LLM developments — especially Claude Code, agentic AI, AI and small business systems 3. Canada/Toronto business — things that affect operations, relevant Toronto networking opportunities Have one story from each bucket daily
[message_id: 1468612942143688737]
assistant: Done! Headlines now structured as **one story per bucket**:

1. **SlideHeroes impact** — New AI presentation tools, SaaS GTM, AEO
2. **AI/LLM developments** — Claude Code, agentic AI, AI + small business systems  
3. **Canada/Toronto** — Business ops, Toronto networking opportunities

Guarantees relevant coverage across all three areas every morning.
