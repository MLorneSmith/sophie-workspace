# 2025-02-09 — Session Notes

## Evening Session (with Mike)

### GLM/ZAI Fix
- Root cause: env var naming mismatch — `.env` had `GLM_API_KEY`, OpenClaw reads `ZAI_API_KEY`
- API key itself was valid (not expired). Just never getting read.
- Added `ZAI_API_KEY` to both `.clawdbot/.env` and `.openclaw/.env`

### Strategic Objectives — Initiative Structure Complete
Created 35 initiatives across all 7 objectives:
- Obj 1 (Product): 6 initiatives — Core Product, Harden Platform, Knowledge Engine, Launch/Beta, Competitive Intel, Enterprise Data Security/Local-First

- Obj 3 (Convert): 4 — Re-engagement, Platform Migration, Customer Onboarding, Customer Segmentation
- Obj 4 (Acquire): 4 — Outbound Sales, Partnerships/Affiliates, Sales Infrastructure, Inbound Nurture
- Obj 5 (Retain): 3 — Onboarding/Activation, Engagement/Retention, Feedback/Success
- Obj 6 (AI): 4 — Knowledge, Orchestration, Coding, Content (existing)
- Obj 7 (Ops): 5 — MC v2, Customer Data, Financial/Legal, DevOps, Automate Ops

### Q1 Priority Order Confirmed

### Todoist Cleanup
- 18 duplicates closed (cross-project, within-Marketing, Sales/Admin overlaps)
- 3 done tasks closed (GLM, OAuth, GPT router)
- "Build App" merged into "App Build" (24 tasks recreated after accidental deletion)

### Obj 7 Tasks Sorted
All 49+ tasks assigned to 5 initiatives. Zero orphans.

## Night Work (Solo)

### Sophie Loop Phase 6: Orchestrator Wiring — DONE
Built `orchestrator.py` with 4 commands:
- `plan` — Select tasks from backlog, priority-ordered by strategic objective
- `next-batch` — Pick N tasks for parallel execution
- `consistency` — Cross-task consistency check prompt generation
- `escalate` — Detect iteration cap, disagreements, blocks

Plus `orchestrate.sh` wrapper for full task lifecycle.

### Sophie Loop Phase 7: Test Run — IN PROGRESS
Running task #76 (Find best-practice presentations) through full loop as test.
