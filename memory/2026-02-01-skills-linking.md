[message_id: 1467562891350638755]
assistant: Let me check where the new skills landed and what needs linking.
assistant: Found them! Two new skills in `~/.local/share/skills.sh/` that need linking to `~/.clawdbot/skills/`:

- **blog-post-optimizer**
- **tailwind-design-system**
assistant: Done! Linked both:
- **blog-post-optimizer**
- **tailwind-design-system**

They'll be available on my next session (or after a `/restart`). Want me to restart now so
