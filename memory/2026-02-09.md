## Capture System v2 — Designed & Approved
- Brainstormed with Mike a comprehensive information capture system replacing the best-practices-only pipeline
- **11 intent types**: best-practice, competitive-intel, inspiration-design, inspiration-email, inspiration-content, market-insight, case-study, quote-stat, technical-ref, automate-with-sophie, voice-context, general-learning
- **Two input channels**: Discord #capture + email forwarding to capture@slideheroes.com (alias configured by Mike)
- **Key features**: user notes as primary categorization signal, confidence flag (ask when unsure), intent-specific extraction, always retain original URL + raw content
- **Replaces /practices** in Mission Control with new /captures page
- Design doc: `docs/plans/2026-02-09-capture-system-v2-design.md`
- Task #262 created (high priority, backlog)

## YouTube Transcript Solution — RESOLVED
- Supadata API works! API key in `~/.clawdbot/.env` as `SUPADATA_API_KEY`
- All other methods fail from AWS (youtube-transcript-api, yt-dlp, browser automation — all IP blocked)
- Tested successfully with Connor Murray SDR video (43K chars)
- Task #220 closed
- Previous research recommended Webshare proxy ($3.50/mo) but Supadata is simpler — one API call vs managing proxy infrastructure

## MC ↔ Todoist Sync — Rewritten
- Old script created duplicates (name matching) and had no deletion support
- **New script uses**: Todoist Sync API (delta-based with sync_token), ID-only matching, soft-close deletions with 7-day tombstones
- State file: `~/clawd/config/todoist-sync-state.json` (sync_token, tombstones, known_links)
- First full sync completed: 85 updated, 13 closed, 0 duplicates
- Cron re-enabled after successful run
- **MC is source of truth for new tasks** — Todoist→MC only syncs completions and renames, never creates

## Massive Backlog Cleanup
- Went through ~100+ backlog tasks with Mike
- Deleted ~40+ duplicates, obsolete, and test tasks
- Consolidated clusters: SEO (6→2), email (7→1), outbound (5→1), YouTube influencers (3→1), partnerships (8→1), PowerPoint tools (2→1), launch phases (5→1), Xero (3→1), competitive intel (4→1), PostHog (3→1)
- Added descriptions to ~30+ tasks that were title-only
- Moved blog post ideas to `deliverables/ideas-and-notes.md`
- Reassigned 19 product dev tasks to Mike

## Key Decisions / New Info
- **CRM is Attio** (not folk CRM) — already set up
- **Email platform**: migrating from ActiveCampaign to Loops
- **DDM = "Decks for Decision Makers"** (the course name)
- **Brand re-evaluation on the table** — even the SlideHeroes name is up for discussion
- Mike uses **Readwise** (needs Feedly feed import)

## Sophie Loop Tasks Created (#345-351)
- 7 tasks extracted from Sophie Loop design doc
- Critical path: Mike reviews context files (#345) + agent profiles (#346) → production test (#347) → integrate into nightly crons (#348)
- Also: Ready for Review workflow (#349), context maintenance (#350), feedback learning loop (#351)

## AWS Cost Analysis
- Base cost: ~$2.65/day ($62/mo EC2 + $9/mo IPv4 + $10/mo EBS)
- Variable: $1-5/day from spot instances (nightly sub-agent coding)
- Updated cost script to report full AWS bill, not just EC2 compute
- Task #352: Mike to purchase 1-Year Reserved Instance (saves $21/mo / $254/yr)
- RI pricing: $0.056/hr vs current $0.085/hr (34% savings)

## Files Created/Modified
- `docs/plans/2026-02-09-capture-system-v2-design.md` — capture system design
