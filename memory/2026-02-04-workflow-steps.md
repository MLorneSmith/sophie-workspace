## Conversation Summary

assistant: Based on my Todoist search, I found the workflow pieces in your sprint planning tasks:

**The four steps appear to be:**
1. **Blocks** (or Brief?) — initial input/assembly
2. **Outline** — canvas module for section/slide organization  
3. **Storyboard** — visual grid with drag-drop reordering
4. **Generate** — AI content generation from storyboard

The app routes show: `blocks` → `canvas` → `storyboard` → `publisher`

Is that the sequence you were looking for? Or was the first step specifically called "Brief" instead of "Blocks"?
