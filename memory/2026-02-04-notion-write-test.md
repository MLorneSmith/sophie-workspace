I can read them now. Want me to do a quick write test to confirm I can add entries, or should I mark that Todoist task as complete?

Created test entries in both and cleaned them up. The #capture workflow is good to go — I can now extract best practices from links and add them directly to Notion. Want me to mark that Todoist task complete?
