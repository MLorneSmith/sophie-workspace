## Conversation Summary

assistant: I'll install it for you — the official AWS installer works better than apt anyway.
user: [Discord Guild #general channel id:1466532593754312899 +1m 2026-02-03 14:40 UTC] slideheroes: let me know when you are done

assistant: Done! ✅
assistant: AWS CLI is installed and ready. You can now run:

```bash
aws configure
```

It'll prompt you for the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region (`us-east-1`), and output format (`json`).
user: [Discord Guild #general channel id:1466532593754312899 +56s 2026-02-03 14:41 UTC] slideheroes: OK. that is done. do you remember why we were doing this?

assistant: Yep! We're setting up cost tracking so I can tell you how much this EC2 environment costs each day — planning to include it in the Morning Brief.

Let's test it:

```bash
~/clawd/scripts/get-ec2-daily-cost.sh
```

Should return yesterday's EC2 cost as JSON. Want to run that and see if it works?
user: [Discord Guild #general channel id:1466532593754312899 +9s 2026-02-03 14:42 UTC] slideheroes: yes
[message_id: 1468255274552004739]
assistant: 🎉 Working! Yesterday's EC2 cost was **$0.74**.

That's about $22/month — pretty lean. I'll add this to the Morning Brief so you get a daily cost update automatically.
