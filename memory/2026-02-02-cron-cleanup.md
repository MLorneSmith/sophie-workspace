assistant: Hey Mike! 👋 What can I help you with today?
user: [Discord Guild #general channel id:1466532593754312899 +30s 2026-02-02 16:06 UTC] slideheroes: we have a Todoist cleanup cronjob being listed in Cron Jobs. Is this an old Job? Should we remove it?
[message_id: 1467914087995412603]
assistant: Yes, that's an old one-shot job from Jan 31st. It already ran (and completed successfully) — it was a one-time task to review your Todoist setup after migrating from Akiflow. It's disabled now and just taking up space.

Safe to remove. Want me to delete it?
