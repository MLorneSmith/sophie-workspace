# Notion Reorganization by Strategic Objectives

**Date:** Feb 9, 2026
**Task:** #260
**Status:** Partially complete — needs Mike's review for page moves

## What I Did

### 1. Created Strategic Objectives Hub
**URL:** https://www.notion.so/Strategic-Objectives-Hub-302f3cb436b181909402c480ac2c24cf

A central page under "Second Brain" that maps all existing Notion pages to their strategic objective. Each of the 7 objectives has a section listing the relevant pages.

### 2. Added "Objective" Property to Resources Database
The Resources database now has an "Objective" select property with all 7 objectives. New captures can be tagged by objective.

### 3. Best Practices Database — Needs Sharing
The Best Practices database (18d2323e) isn't shared with the Sophie integration. Mike needs to share it so I can add the Objective property there too.

## What Mike Needs to Do

1. **Review the mapping above** — Are pages in the right objectives?
2. **Share Best Practices database** with the Sophie integration
3. **Decide on page moves** — Should I physically move pages under objective sections, or just keep the Hub as a navigation layer?
4. **Add objective tags** to existing Resources and Best Practices entries (or I can do this if Best Practices is shared)

## Recommendation

Keep the Hub page as a **navigation layer** rather than physically moving pages. This avoids breaking any existing bookmarks or references. Over time, new content can be created directly under the appropriate objective section.
