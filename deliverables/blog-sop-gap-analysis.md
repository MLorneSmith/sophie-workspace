# Blog Writing SOP — Gap Analysis

**Based on:** Perplexity research (3 queries, sonar-pro model)  
**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Purpose:** Identify gaps in our Blog Writing SOP v3 against industry best practices  

---

## ✅ What Our SOP Already Covers Well

| Best Practice | Our SOP | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| Topic ideation with keyword research | Phase 1 | ✅ Solid — includes dedup check |
| Content pillar alignment | Phase 1 | ✅ Via content context system |
| Deep research beyond top results | Phase 3 (3-layer model) | ✅ Strong — academic papers, reports, contrarian views |
| Outline with SEO structure | Phase 4 | ✅ Template + best practices |
| AEO optimization | Phase 4 | ✅ Direct answers, FAQ format, schema-friendly |
| Builder → reviewer iteration | Phase 5 | ✅ Sophie Loop handles this |
| Mike review gate | Phase 6 | ✅ Clear approve/revise/kill workflow |
| Context system integration | Throughout | ✅ Unique strength — few teams have this |
| E-E-A-T signals | Phase 4 (structure) | ✅ Partially — cite sources, expert insights |

## 🔴 Gaps Identified

### Gap 1: Content Brief (Missing)
**What research says:** High-performing teams use detailed, standardized content briefs that include audience profile, core message, format/length, tone/voice, SEO keywords, success metrics, and repurposing plans. Briefs reduce misalignment and revisions by up to 30%.

**Our gap:** We go from outline directly to writing. There's no formal brief that synthesizes Phase 3 (research) + Phase 4 (outline) into a single document the writer agent consumes.

**Recommendation:** Add a **Content Brief** step between Outline and Draft (or merge into the outline output). Include:
- Target audience + persona
- Core message / thesis
- Tone/voice notes (from content pillars)
- SEO keywords + intent
- Success metrics (what does "good" look like for this post?)
- Repurposing plan (can this become a LinkedIn post, email, slide deck?)

---

### Gap 2: Pre-Publish QA Checklist (Missing)
**What research says:** Top teams use explicit QA checklists before publishing: accuracy, brand consistency, SEO optimization, peer review sign-off, link checks, image alt-text, schema markup.

**Our gap:** Phase 6 (Review) is Mike reading and giving feedback. There's no structured checklist of things to verify before the post reaches Mike.

**Recommendation:** Add a **QA Checklist** that runs after Sophie Loop approval but before Mike review:
- [ ] Factual accuracy — all claims verifiable?
- [ ] All sources cited and linked
- [ ] Target keyword in H1, meta description, at least one H2
- [ ] Internal links to 2-3 related SlideHeroes posts
- [ ] No orphan pages created
- [ ] Images have alt-text
- [ ] Schema markup defined (Article schema)
- [ ] Meta description 150-160 chars
- [ ] URL slug is clean and keyword-rich
- [ ] Readability score acceptable
- [ ] Word count within target range
- [ ] CTA present and clear

---

### Gap 3: Post-Publish Optimization (Weak)
**What research says:** Best teams measure performance against KPIs, regularly audit and refresh old content, repurpose top performers, and iterate based on data during quarterly reviews.

**Our gap:** Phase 7 mentions "track performance" but doesn't define what metrics, when to check, or when to update. No content refresh/audit process.

**Recommendation:** Expand Phase 7 or create a separate **Content Performance SOP** covering:
- Define KPIs per post (organic traffic, keyword ranking, time on page, conversions)
- 30/60/90 day performance review cadence
- Criteria for refreshing old content (ranking dropped, info outdated, new angle available)
- Repurposing pipeline: blog → LinkedIn post → email → slide deck → social snippets
- Quarterly content audit process

---

### Gap 4: Repurposing Plan (Missing)
**What research says:** Top teams plan repurposing at the brief stage — every blog post should be designed to become multiple content pieces.

**Our gap:** No mention of repurposing anywhere in the SOP. Each blog post is treated as a standalone deliverable.

**Recommendation:** Add a repurposing section to the Content Brief:
- LinkedIn post (summary + key insight)
- Email newsletter segment
- Social media snippets (3-5 pull quotes)
- Potential slide deck / visual
- Podcast talking points (if applicable)

---

### Gap 5: E-E-A-T Signals (Partial)
**What research says:** Search engines in 2025-2026 prioritize Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. Key signals: author bio/credentials, real-world case studies, proprietary data, expert quotes, trust builders.

**Our gap:** We mention citing sources and using research, but don't explicitly address:
- Author attribution (Mike's credentials as the byline)
- Author bio/schema for E-E-A-T
- Using Mike's personal experience as a differentiator
- Trust signals (company credibility, client results)

**Recommendation:** Add E-E-A-T section to Phase 4 (Outline):
- Every post should include at least one personal experience/anecdote from Mike
- Author bio schema markup on every post
- Reference Mike's background where relevant (ex-Mastercard, LBS, consulting)
- Include specific results/data where possible

---

### Gap 6: AI Content Transparency (Not Addressed)
**What research says:** Best practice for AI-assisted teams: define AI usage rules in playbooks, maintain human QA for brand voice, consider transparency labels.

**Our gap:** We don't address how we handle the AI-assisted nature of our content. This is both an ethical and a practical concern (search engines may develop AI content detection).

**Recommendation:** Add a section on AI content guidelines:
- Sophie drafts, Mike reviews and approves — Mike is the author
- Mike adds personal insights, anecdotes, and voice refinements
- No "AI-generated" labels needed if Mike genuinely reviews and shapes the content
- Quality bar: every post should reflect Mike's actual thinking, not just AI-generated advice

---

### Gap 7: Visual Planning in Outline (Missing)
**What research says:** Plan visuals (infographics, charts, tables, images) during the outline stage. Visuals every 200-300 words improve engagement and scannability.

**Our gap:** Outline template doesn't include visual planning. No mention of images, charts, or infographics.

**Recommendation:** Add to outline template:
- Identify 2-3 opportunities for visuals per post
- Types: framework diagrams, comparison tables, process flowcharts, data charts
- Plan image alt-text at outline stage
- Consider featured image concept

---

### Gap 8: Distribution Plan (Weak)
**What research says:** Publish then promote via relevant channels (LinkedIn for B2B, newsletters, social). Interlink from 3-5 existing pages.

**Our gap:** Phase 7 mentions "share on social channels" as a bullet point but no structured distribution plan.

**Recommendation:** Either expand Phase 7 or add Phase 8 (Distribution):
- LinkedIn post (same day as publish)
- Email newsletter (next scheduled send)
- Cross-link from 3-5 existing SlideHeroes pages
- Social media posts (schedule 3-5 over following week)
- Share in relevant communities/Slack groups
