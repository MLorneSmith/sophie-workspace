## Section 5: Recommended New Content Pillars

---

### Pillar #1: Workflow & Productivity Mastery

**Description:** Practical tactics, shortcuts, and systems for creating professional presentations faster and with less friction. Focus on the consulting workflow—from brief to deck—optimizing every step.

**Evidence Sources:**
- Reddit: "How to get better at creating slides?" and template fatigue discussions
- Reddit: Tool discussions (Slideworks, PowerTools, PresentationExcellence)
- LinkedIn: Planning and preparation emphasis
- Beautiful.ai: "10-Minute Presentation Workflow" content
- Search results: Keyboard shortcuts, workflow optimization articles

**Search Demand:** **HIGH** – "PowerPoint shortcuts," "workflow optimization," "create slides faster" are consistently searched

**Differentiation Potential:** **HIGH** – Most competitors focus on design or AI. SlideHeroes can own the practical, day-to-day workflow consulting experience.

**Suggested Cadence:** **3 posts/month**

**Example Topic Ideas:**
1. "The 15 Keyboard Shortcuts Every Consultant Should Know"
2. "Building Your Personal Slide Library: What to Save and How to Organize"
3. "MBB Workflow: How McKinsey Teams Build Decks from Brief to Delivery"
4. "From Client Brief to Final Deck: A 5-Step Consulting Workflow"

- LinkedIn: Structure frameworks (PIP approach), audience understanding
- Beautiful.ai: Sales pitch content ("Best AI Presentation Makers for Your Sales Pitch")
- Pitch.com: Strong emphasis on sales enablement, digital sales rooms
- Adjacent research: Sales-focused presentation content, client relationship themes

**Search Demand:** **HIGH** – "pitch deck," "sales presentation," "winning presentations" are high-volume queries

**Differentiation Potential:** **MEDIUM** – Pitch.com and Beautiful.ai cover this, but SlideHeroes can differentiate with consulting methodology depth (MBB approach, Pyramid Principle, MECE framing)

**Suggested Cadence:** **3 posts/month**

**Example Topic Ideas:**
1. "The Pyramid Principle in Sales: Structuring Pitches That Get Decisions"
2. "MBB Client Pitch Format: What Big Consulting Firms Do Differently"
3. "5 Elements Every Consulting Proposal Deck Must Have"

### Pillar #3: Delivery & Performance

- LinkedIn: Multiple posts on delivery techniques ("10 Tips for Delivering," transitions, engaging virtual audiences)
- Presentation Guru site structure: Performance, Charisma, Rehearsal categories
- Adjacent research: Thought leaders covering storytelling, persuasion, authenticity

**Search Demand:** **MEDIUM** – "presentation skills," "public speaking," "delivery tips" are searched, though less than design/templates

**Differentiation Potential:** **HIGH** – This is a significant gap in the competitive landscape. Most presentation blogs focus on slides; few focus on the human performance aspect. SlideHeroes can own "Consulting Presentation Performance."

**Suggested Cadence:** **2 posts/month**

**Example Topic Ideas:**
1. "Beyond Bullets: How to Present Consulting Slides Without Reading Them"
2. "The Executive Presence Formula: How Consultants Command the Room"
3. "Handling Q&A: What MBB Consultants Do When Questions Get Tough"
