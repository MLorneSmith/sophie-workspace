# Notion Workspace Audit

*Generated: 2026-02-04*

---

## Summary

**Total items found:** ~100 (pages + databases)
- Workspace-level pages: ~40
- Database entries & child pages: ~60
- Many untitled/empty placeholder entries

---

## 🗑️ RECOMMEND DELETING

These pages appear obsolete, empty, or no longer useful:

### Outdated Content
| Page | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **Christmas List 2024** | Outdated (over a year old) |
| **Japan** | Travel planning notes from Sep 2025 — trip likely completed |
| **To do** | Generic "to do" page — superseded by Todoist |

### Empty/Placeholder Pages
| Page | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **5** 💼 | Cryptic name, likely test page |
| **Quick Note** 📌 | Generic capture — Inbox will replace this |
| All **"Untitled"** pages in databases | ~30+ empty entries across GTD, Idea Lists, etc. |

### Abandoned Templates/Systems
| Page | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **GTD** (entire section) | Has an Inbox, Areas, Projects structure but appears unused (all entries untitled). Being replaced by new Second Brain system |
| **Personal Home** 🏡 | Contains Todoist import junk ("Idea List — ...") — messy, not useful |
| **Kanban - Tasks** | Old task board, superseded by Mission Control |

### Todoist Import Junk (under Personal Home)
These all appear to be Todoist template text, not real content:
- "Idea List — Feel free to archive this section..."
- "Idea List — This weekly review template is based on..."
- "Idea List — Use this document template..."
- "Idea List — Food ideas" (duplicate)
- "Idea Lists (from Todoist)"

**Recommendation:** Delete all "Idea List —" pages and the parent container.

| Merge These | Into |
|-------------|------|
| **Newsletter ideas** + **Content Ideas** | Single "Content Ideas" page in SlideHeroes |
| **AI Competitor Research** + child pages (Gamma, Pitch, Plus, etc.) | Keep hierarchy, just relocate |
| **Remaining Projects** + **Repository Feature inventory** | Review for duplication, consolidate in Mission Control |
| **New tools & processes** + **New AI systems** | Single "Tools & Systems" reference in Sophie/Systems |
| Duplicate **"Food ideas"** pages | Delete one |

---

## ✅ KEEP AS-IS (Already Well-Organized)

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Readwise** + Library database | Functioning integration — keep |
| **Resources** database | Already created for Second Brain — keep |
| **Best Practices** database | Already created for Second Brain — keep |
| **My links** 📚 database | Bookmarks collection — could merge into Resources later |

## Migration Priority

1. **Delete junk first** — Untitled pages, Todoist imports, outdated lists
2. **Create Second Brain root** — Mike creates the parent page
3. **Build structure** — I create Areas and databases
4. **Migrate content** — Move valuable pages into new structure
5. **Archive old** — Move remaining old pages to Archive before deleting

---

## Questions for Mike

1. **Japan page** — Trip completed? Safe to delete?
2. **Christmas List 2024** — Delete or archive for reference?
3. **GTD system** — Completely abandon, or salvage any structure?
4. **Personal Home** — Delete entirely after extracting any value?
5. **My links database** — Merge into Resources or keep separate?
