## Why This Matters for SlideHeroes

Mike asked to extract the **entire approach** for building sales capability. Connor Murray's framework is a complete, structured SDR operating system — from pre-work (list building + templates) through execution (cold email + cold calling) to systemization (cadences + metrics + AI leverage). This is directly applicable to building SlideHeroes' outbound sales motion.

## The SDR Ramp Pyramid (Hierarchy of Needs)

Connor's core framework. Most SDRs don't fail because they lack effort or skill — **they focus on the right things in the wrong order.** The pyramid defines the correct sequence:

```
        ┌─────────────┐
        │  SYSTEMIZE   │  Cadences, time blocking, metrics, AI
        ├─────────────┤
        │    CRAFT     │  Cold email, cold calling, objection handling
        ├─────────────┤
        │  COIL THE    │  List building, targeting, persona templates,
        │   SPRING     │  scripts — all prep BEFORE execution
        └─────────────┘
```

**Key insight:** Front-load your prep. Build everything in advance so your day becomes simple execution instead of daily friction.

## Layer 1: Coiling the Spring (Prep & Targeting)

### What This Means
Before you make a single call or send a single email, build:
- **Targeted account lists** — focused, researched accounts (not spray-and-pray)
- **Persona-specific templates** — different messaging for different roles
- **Scripts and value statements** — rehearsed and ready to deploy
- **Research notes** — industry context, company triggers, persona pain points

### The 5×5 Method
Pick **5 accounts** and **5 prospects per account** to focus on each week. This allows:
- Deeper research per account
- Personalized, relevant outreach
- Meaningful connections instead of volume-only approach

### SDR Tech Stack Essentials
What you actually need to ramp (tools change, principles don't):
- **CRM** — track all activity and pipeline
- **Sales engagement platform** — sequence/cadence automation
- **Prospecting/enrichment tools** — find contacts, validate data
- **AI tools** — script creation, research, call summaries (see Layer 3)

## Layer 2: The Craft (Cold Email + Cold Calling)

### Cold Email: The "Who Why What" Framework + Assumptive Tone

**Structure every cold email with three elements:**

1. **WHO** — Who you are and who you help
2. **WHY** — Why you're reaching out to THEM specifically (trigger, relevance)
3. **WHAT** — What you want (a meeting, not a sale)

**Assumptive tone:** Write as if the meeting makes obvious sense. Don't ask for permission — assume value and propose a time.

### Follow-Up Sequences That Drive Replies
- Keep follow-ups simple and repeatable
- Don't rewrite from scratch each time
- Each follow-up should add a new angle or piece of value
- Designed for consistency, not creativity each time

### Cold Calling: The Value Statement Framework

**3-Part Structure (from Oracle's top SDR team):**

**Part 1 — Opening (Assumptive Formality)**
- Simple, natural greeting: "Hey [Name], this is [You] from [Company] — how are you?"
- Downward inflection — sounds casual, not like a trick
- Goal: get a quick formality back and move into value

**Part 2 — Value Statement (30-45 seconds)**
Cover three things:
- **Who you are** — your role and team
- **Why you're calling them specifically** — industry, role, relevant trigger
- **What you want** — a meeting, not the sale

**Example:**
> "I'm part of the team that supports life science companies on back office financial applications. We help reduce reliance on spreadsheets and automate month-end reporting across clinical trial planning, supply chain execution, and commercialization. I know I called you out of the blue here — just looking to set aside time next week to get introduced and align with your priorities."

**Part 3 — Close (Ask for Time)**
> "How's your calendar next week on Wednesday or Thursday?"

### Adapting by Persona and Industry
- Same framework, tailored message
- Change the industry references and pain points per persona
- Keep the structure tight, rehearse until natural

### Cold Calling Mindset & Tonality
**"Sell the meeting, not the product."**
- Your job on a cold call is to earn 30 minutes, not close a deal
- Tonality matters more than words — confident, relaxed, professional
- Push through discomfort — cold calling builds the skill set that pays off long-term (discovery, enterprise deals, objection handling)

---

## Objection Handling: Two Frameworks

### Framework 1: Acknowledge → Reassert → Advance (ARA)
For standard pushback — acknowledge their concern, reassert your value, advance to the ask.

**Example:**
> Objection: "We already work with [Competitor]."
> Response: "That's actually why I'm reaching out. We work with customers of [Competitor] all the time. This is more to get introduced and align on your priorities going forward. Would Wednesday or Thursday work?"

**Rule: Ask for the meeting TWICE before opening up with questions.**

### Framework 2: Ask → Clarify → Expand (ACE)
For when you need to learn more — ask a clarifying question, dig deeper, then expand the conversation.

**Use after two "asks" have been attempted:**
> "Totally understand. Just to clarify, are you currently handling [specific gap] with internal tooling or another provider?"

### Objection Prep
- Build **flashcards** for your 3-5 most common objections
- Know your responses cold
- **This alone separates top 10% reps from everyone else**

---

## Layer 3: Systemize (Cadences, Time Blocking, Metrics, AI)

### The ABAB Cadence
Alternating outreach pattern for consistent execution:
- **A = Call** → **B = Email** → **A = Call** → **B = Email**
- Creates a multi-channel rhythm without overthinking sequence
- Predictable, repeatable, trackable

### Time Blocking for Consistent Execution
- Block specific times for calls, emails, research, admin
- Don't bounce between tasks — batch similar activities
- Protect your calling blocks like appointments

### Metrics Worth Tracking
- **Calls made** — activity baseline
- **Answer rate** — % of calls picked up
- **Set rate** — % of conversations → meetings booked
- **Open/reply/conversion rate** — email engagement
- **Show rate** — % of booked meetings that happen
- **Pipeline per meeting** — revenue potential per meeting

### Leveraging AI to Accelerate Ramp (2026)
Use AI to create:
- **Scripts** — persona-specific value statements
- **Templates** — cold email drafts tailored to verticals
- **Research** — account intelligence, trigger events, competitive landscape
- **Summaries** — call notes, meeting prep, follow-up drafts

**AI creates a real productivity edge** — use it to compress prep time, not replace the human elements of selling.
