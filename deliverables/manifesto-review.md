# SlideHeroes Manifesto Review

**Reviewed:** 2026-02-10
**Manifesto Version:** v1
**Reviewer:** Sophie

---

## Executive Summary

This is a **good** manifesto that needs to be **great**. The core message is solid, but the execution gets bogged down in technical abstraction and loses the punchy, contrarian voice that makes SlideHeroes compelling.

**Key Verdict:** Cut 30-40%, sharpen the voice, and make it more concrete. The audience is busy professionals — they don't need a treatise on LLMs. They need to understand why their credibility is at risk and what SlideHeroes actually does.

---

## 1. Messaging Clarity

### What Works
- The core message is clear: AI-generated presentations are fast but lack quality; methodology matters more than generation speed.
- The distinction between "AI-generated" vs. "AI-orchestrated" is valuable.

### What's Problematic
- The message gets buried in jargon: "agentic workflows," "context engineering," "deterministic steps."
- The "crisis" framing in Chapter 1 is strong, but then the manifesto drifts into AI theory before circling back to the user's problem.
- For the target audience (individual consultants, small/medium consultancies), the pain point isn't abstract — it's "I need to deliver McKinsey-quality work on a solo budget."

### Recommendation
Lead with the concrete pain: "You're competing with Big 4 firms. AI just leveled the playing field on speed. Now methodology is your edge."

---

## 2. Brand Voice

### What's On-Brand
- "The tools got faster. The thinking didn't get better." → Perfect contrarian voice.
- "Structure beats style; substance beats sizzle; thinking beats generating." → Direct, authoritative.
- The "hidden crisis" framing in Chapter 1 → Good contrarian hook.

### What's Off-Brand
- **Too academic:** "LLMs have unlocked incredible productivity, but require narrow focus to handle complex, meaningful work." This reads like a research paper, not a manifesto.
- **Too hedging:** "Consider how this plays out across professions" → Just say it directly.
- **Too generic:** "Everything changes" (Chapter 6) → Vague and un-SlideHeroes.
- **Missing "generous" element:** The manifesto talks at the reader but doesn't teach. The brand voice is supposed to give away insights freely.

### Recommendation
Rewrite Chapter 3 and 4 in the brand voice. Stop explaining AI like a researcher; explain it like an experienced consultant talking to a junior. Use more contrarian hooks: "Here's what nobody tells you about AI and presentations..."

---

## 3. Persuasiveness

### What Works
- The problem is real: AI decks look generic, and professionals risk their credibility by using them.
- The "gap widening" insight is strong — AI didn't solve the thinking problem.
- The future vision is compelling: "The 20-hour deck becomes a 4-hour deck — with better thinking."

### What's Missing
- **Urgency** — Why fix this now? The manifesto doesn't make clear that early adopters of methodology+AI will have an advantage.
- **Fear** — There's no "this is what's happening to your career if you don't get this" moment.
- **FOMO** — No sense that others are already figuring this out and pulling ahead.
- **Specific stakes** — What exactly happens when you present an AI-generated deck to a CFO?

### Recommendation
Add a section (or punch up Chapter 1) with concrete stakes: "You've seen them. The deck that looks professional but says nothing. The recommendation that could have been written by ChatGPT. And you know what happens next: 'Thanks, we'll think about it.' Which means no. Which means you're out."

---

## 4. Structure & Flow

### What Works
- The chapter structure is logical: problem → what we learned → AI limitations → solution → vision → possibilities → path forward.
- The narrative arc from "we built courses" to "AI arrived" to "we're building something new" tells a story.

### What's Problematic
- **Chapter 3 is a black hole.** It's too long, too technical, and loses the reader. The tax lawyer/accountant/salesperson examples are fine but don't connect back to the core message fast enough.
- **Chapter 4 is too abstract.** The definitions of "workflows" vs "agentic workflows" vs "full agents" is taxonomy, not manifesto. Readers don't care about your taxonomy; they care about what works.
- **Chapter 6 is too vague.** "Everything changes" followed by generic benefits. Be specific.
- **Chapter 7 is weak.** Five steps that are process, not conviction. Manifestos should end with conviction, not a checklist.

### Recommendation
- Cut Chapter 3 to half its length. Focus on the key insight: "AI needs context. Generic AI has none. That's why AI decks are forgettable."
- Rewrite Chapter 4 to focus on the *why*, not the what. "Why agentic workflows? Because high-stakes presentations demand structure AND intelligence."
- End with a punch, not a process. The "Our Manifesto" section is good but buried at the end.

## 5. Specificity

### What's Vague
- **"Proven presentation frameworks"** → Which ones? Name them (Pyramid Principle, SCQ, MECE).
- **"Industry-specific patterns"** → Give one example. What's a financial services pattern vs a tech pattern?
- **"Consistent quality across every deliverable"** → What does quality look like?
- **"The methodology that used to live in the heads of your best people"** → Great line, but back it up with an example of what that methodology IS.

### What's Concrete (Good)
- "Pyramid principle, situation-complication-resolution, issue trees"
- "The three things that actually matter to the CEO"
- "The 20-hour deck becomes a 4-hour deck"

### Recommendation
Add 2-3 concrete examples of:
1. A bad AI-generated slide vs. a methodology-driven slide
2. What "audience persona models" means in practice (CFO cares about X, CMO cares about Y)
3. A specific "before/after" showing the SlideHeroes approach

---

## 6. What's Missing

### 1. The SlideHeroes Credibility
The manifesto mentions "we built courses" but doesn't mention:
- Seneca College adoption
- US Department of Energy partnership
- Mike's background

This social proof is your authority. Without it, this could be written by anyone.

### 2. The "How" — What Do I Actually Do?
The manifesto explains what SlideHeroes IS building, but not what the user DOES. Do they take a course? Use a tool? Both? What's the actual experience?

### 3. The Competitive Differentiation
What makes this different from Gamma, Tome, Beautiful.ai? The manifesto hints at "methodology" but doesn't contrast explicitly. A strong manifesto would say: "Here's why the AI presentation tools get it wrong."

### 4. The Pain of "Good Enough"
Most professionals are okay with "good enough." The manifesto needs to explain why good enough is dangerous in an age where everyone can produce good enough.

### 5. The "We've Been Here Before" Angle
The manifesto could draw parallels: PowerPoint democratized design and quality suffered. AI democratizes content and quality will suffer again — unless methodology intervenes.

### 6. More Generous Insight
The brand voice says "give away valuable insights freely." The manifesto is about what SlideHeroes is building, not what the reader can learn. Add one section that teaches something immediately actionable.

---

## 7. What to Cut

### High Priority (Cut or Condense)
1. **The tax lawyer/accountant/salesperson examples in Chapter 3** → Keep the insight, cut the examples. Or make them one sentence each.
2. **The workflow/agentic workflow/full agent taxonomy in Chapter 4** → This is internal thinking, not public manifesto.
3. **Chapter 7 entirely** → It's a process guide, not manifesto material. The "Our Manifesto" section at the end does this better.

### Medium Priority (Trim)
1. **Chapter 3's bullet list** → Trim to 3-4 key items, not 7.
2. **Chapter 6's generalities** → Cut the "for organizations" and "for teams" sections unless you make them specific.
3. **"The Path Forward" section** → Replace with a stronger call to action.

### Low Priority (Polish)
1. Some flowery language: "quiet terror," "dirty secret" → These are fine but could be sharper.
2. The "This is what SlideHeroes is building" line appears multiple times. Once is enough.

---

## Recommended Rewrites

### Rewrite: Chapter 3 (The Problem with AI and Presentations)

**BEFORE (current version is ~500 words):**
[Full text as-is — too long and academic]

**AFTER (contrarian, direct, ~250 words):**

---

### Chapter 3: The AI Trap

**Here's what nobody tells you about AI presentations:**

ChatGPT can write. It cannot think.

It can generate a deck about "Q3 Strategy Review" in 30 seconds. The slides will look professional. The structure will seem logical. The text will be grammatically perfect.

And it will be forgotten the moment you leave the room.

Because a CFO doesn't want a professional deck. They want a *correct* deck. And correct requires context they didn't give to any AI:

- What this company has already tried (and failed at)
- Which recommendations will trigger budget battles with Marketing
- What the CEO actually cares about this quarter (hint: it's not everything)
- The unstated politics that determine what gets approved and what doesn't

Generic AI doesn't know any of this. So it produces generic decks.

And here's the problem: **generic is worse than bad.**

A bad deck gets pushback. A generic deck gets polite nods, then nothing. You walk out thinking "that went well" while they're already moving on to someone else.

Your credibility drains away in the "thanks, we'll think about it."

---

### Rewrite: The "Our Manifesto" Section (Make This the Ending)

**BEFORE (buried at the end):**
[As-is]

**AFTER (punchy, conviction, as the final section):**

---

### This Is What We Believe

**Presentation skills are the most underrated capability in professional life.**

The professionals who advance fastest aren't necessarily the smartest. They're the ones who can walk into a boardroom and make a case that sticks. This isn't charisma. It's craft — and almost nobody teaches it.

**AI is making the gap wider, not closing it.**

Anyone can generate slides now. Anyone can make them look polished. But the ability to structure an argument that survives partner review? To distill a complex analysis into what actually matters to a decision-maker? That's rare. And it's getting rarer.

**Structure beats style. Every time.**

Your CFO doesn't want to be inspired. They want to be convinced. They want evidence, not emotion. They want to know what you recommend, why it's right, and what happens if they say no.

**The future belongs to those who master methodology AND know how to orchestrate AI.**

Not "use AI to do it faster." "Use AI as part of a disciplined workflow that produces better thinking."

**This is what we're building.**

The methodology that teaches professionals how to think about presentations. The agentic workflows that amplify human judgment with AI. The foundational context that makes AI actually useful for high-stakes communication.

A future where every professional can communicate with the clarity and impact that used to require years at McKinsey.

**Presentations that think.**

Because in the age of AI, the ability to communicate with clarity and conviction isn't just a skill — it's a superpower.

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Add a "Before/After" Example
Somewhere in the manifesto, show — don't just tell — the difference:

```
BEFORE (AI-generated):
Slide title: "Q3 Revenue Analysis"
Bullet points:
- Revenue increased 12%
- Strong performance in North America
- Customer satisfaction improved
- Outlook remains positive

AFTER (Methodology-driven):
Slide title: "Q3 Revenue exceeded forecast by 12%, driven by North America expansion"
Supporting points:
- North America +18% vs plan (2 new enterprise accounts)
- Customer NPS +4 points (onboarding improvement)
- Q4 risk: Europe supply chain (potential $2M impact)
- Recommendation: Invest $500K in Europe capacity
```

### 2. Add the Credibility Early
After Chapter 2, add a brief credibility section:

```
We've taught this methodology to thousands of professionals — from Seneca College students to US Department of Energy analysts. The founder spent decades building board-level decks for Mastercard, Oliver Wyman, and Lloyds Banking Group. This isn't theory. It's what works.
```

### 3. Sharpen the Competitive Callout
Add a section that explicitly differentiates:

```
The AI presentation tools want to help you generate faster. We want to help you think better.

Gamma, Tome, Beautiful.ai — they optimize for the output. We optimize for the argument.

Pretty slides don't save bad thinking. Good thinking makes any slide work.
```

### 4. End with a Call to Action
The manifesto should lead somewhere. Consider adding at the very end:

```
Ready to stop presenting and start convincing?

[Learn the methodology] or [Join the waitlist for the AI platform]
```

## Final Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear problem-solution structure
- Strong core insights (AI creates generic decks; methodology matters)
- Good narrative arc from courses to AI to new vision

**Weaknesses:**
- Too long and technical in the middle
- Loses the punchy, contrarian voice that defines SlideHeroes
- Missing social proof and specific examples
- Ends weakly with process instead of conviction

**Action Plan:**
1. Cut 30-40% of the word count
2. Rewrite Chapters 3-4 in brand voice
3. Add concrete before/after examples
4. Weave in credibility markers
5. End with the "This Is What We Believe" section as the closer

This manifesto has the bones of something great. It just needs to stop trying to be comprehensive and start being compelling.
