## Context

- SlideHeroes / 2025slideheroes is an active project area.
- Current focus (safe to save): retired from Mastercard; building **SlideHeroes** (https://www.slideheroes.com) and pivoting it from a course into an AI-powered SaaS product to rapidly prototype business presentations; target customers are individual consultants and small/medium consultancies.
- Background (safe to save): longtime Mastercard leader in Cyber & Intelligence Solutions / Enterprise Risk & Security; deep expertise in payments/cards, fraud/cybersecurity, identity/biometrics, strategy, M&A, standards, and device/application ecosystems (chip/contactless, mobile, wearables, POS/mPOS, IoT). Previously Mastercard Advisors (payments consulting), Lloyds Banking Group (strategy consulting), and Oliver Wyman (strategy consulting). Early career at IBM (direct marketing). Education: London Business School MBA (Strategy & Finance) and UBC B.Comm.

## Preferences

- **Default model (Sophie):** Opus 4.5 (`anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`) — conversation, planning, research, complex reasoning.
- **Coding sub-agents:** GPT-5.2 (`openai-codex/gpt-5.2`) — spawn sub-agents with this model for implementation work.
- **Coding fallback:** GLM 4.7 (`zai/glm-4.7`) — use if GPT-5.2 fails/unavailable.
- **Basic/slow tasks (GLM):** Use GLM for bulk processing, scheduled background jobs, draft generation, data extraction, translation, async code review, research summaries — anything where latency doesn't matter.

## Boundaries

- Default: **do not delete anything anywhere**.
- Exception: Mike pre-approves deleting **(a)** files I created, and **(b)** Clawdbot-related files, when it’s clearly needed.
  - “Clawdbot-related” includes: logs; cache/temp files; generated task artifacts (screenshots, exported PDFs, audio/TTS, bundled outputs); one-off scratch scripts/notes I created; old tool outputs (snapshots/recordings) after they’re no longer useful.
  - Not included: anything Mike created manually; project source code/repos (unless explicitly created as throwaway); anything in/related to **2025slideheroes**.
- **Do not touch** (make changes to) the **2025slideheroes** project on GitHub unless Mike explicitly asks.
